  <div class="entry-content"><p>People often tell me, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; guy. I have two beefs with this statement. It implies that
there&rsquo;s one type of intelligence, usually the logical, analytical kind, and that my smarts are an
innate quality rather than an achievement.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The prevailing notion of intelligence is a narrow and limiting one that fails to embrace the
multitude of human abilities. We define intelligence too often as the ability to analyze
rationally and think deductively. Kids are increasingly, in the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html" title="Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity">words of Sir Ken Robinson</a>,
educated &ldquo;from the neck up.&rdquo; What about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#The_multiple_intelligences" title="Theory of multiple intelligences">other types of intelligence</a> like spatial or
interpersonal? Logical and deductive thinking are important but we shouldn&rsquo;t leave out the others.
To do so would treat children as machines. This is how I write software for computers – I write
explicit instructions – because they are incapable of independent thought. But human minds don&rsquo;t
work that way. Innovative ideas often arise from loose connections between disparate concepts. A
calligraphy class at Reed College inspired Steve Jobs to have multiple typefaces and
proportionally spaced fonts on the first Macintosh computer.</p>

<p>Just as we suffer from the fallacy of a monolithic form of IQ intelligence, we&rsquo;re hampered by the
false authority of IQ tests. Today&rsquo;s popular culture treats IQ tests as a way of identifying
gifted people. The test originated with a French psychologist named Alfred Binet whom the French
government commissioned in 1904 to develop a way of identifying intellectually deficient children
for their placement in special-education programs. It&rsquo;s not possible to design an objective test
that measures an imaginary platonic concept of intelligence that doesn&rsquo;t require cultural
knowledge. For example, original Binet tests included questions like finding three rhymes for the
French word &ldquo;obéisance&rdquo; and the question &ldquo;My neighbor has been receiving strange visitors. He has
received in turn a doctor, a lawyer, and then a priest. What is taking place?&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Modern IQ tests have similar biases. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/28/2/179.html#S-3" title="The Other Alfred Binet">Binet himself warned</a> about his test&rsquo;s limitations, the
narrow way it measured intelligence, and the need to look at the whole of an individual&rsquo;s
abilities.</p>

<p>And while I&rsquo;m the soapbox, let&rsquo;s also discard the idea that the left brain is responsible for
logic and the right for creativity. This is a popular misconception that has been
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904424716/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904424716">clarified</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=easiamus00-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1904424716" alt="" />:</p>

<blockquote><p>A seductive idea that has slipped firmly into popular culture. While there is some localization
  of function, there is no gene, no synaptic connection, no chemical, no area or region, no
  hemisphere in the human brain that is exclusively responsible for any specific behaviour.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the future, this left-right brain dichotomy will be regarded as psuedoscience just like
phrenology and astrology.</p>

<p>The second reason I chafe at being described as &ldquo;smart&rdquo; is because of a <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/" title="How Not to Talk to Your Kids">study</a> that suggests
this label causes kids to underperform. Researcher Carol Dweck gave two groups of children
puzzles. One group was praised for their intelligence and the other for their effort. When given
subsequently harder problems, the first group gave up easily and assumed they weren&rsquo;t actually
that smart after all. The second group weren&rsquo;t afraid of the harder puzzles and performed better.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Emphasizing effort gives a child a variable that they can control,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;They come to
  see themselves as in control of their success. Emphasizing natural intelligence takes it out of
  the child&rsquo;s control, and it provides no good recipe for responding to a failure.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>But the introduction &ldquo;This is so and so. He tries really hard&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t sexy. We want the fruits of
our labor to appear effortless and inborn. It&rsquo;s strange to see sketches of prized artwork and
manuscripts of canonized books because we fantasize about the masterpiece springing full-fledged
from the mind of its creator. Long nights of revisions and elbow grease aren&rsquo;t sexy. Final art
pieces and polished writing are.</p>
