  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished redesigning my site. It was a lot more work than I expected. After becoming
interested in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/17/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/" title="Lessons From Swiss Style Graphic Design">Swiss design</a>, both philosophically and aesthetically, I was inspired by the
personal websites of Rdio and Django designer <a href="http://www.wilsonminer.com/" title="Wilson Miner's personal website">Wilson Miner</a>, former New York Times web
designer <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/" title="Khoi Vinh's personal website">Khoi Vinh</a>, and an <a href="http://www.rodrigogalindez.com/" title="Rodrigo Galindez's personal website">Argentinian designer</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So I took elements from all three and combined them with my own tastes for minimalism, grids, and
readability. At first I was going to unabashedly copy Miner&rsquo;s site since I liked it so much. But
some of my friends said it was confusing at first glance. Although Miner&rsquo;s layout is beautiful, it
might through off short-attention-spanned web surfer who are used to conventional blog layouts.
And users who don&rsquo;t understand a site right away will bounce.</p>

<p>Compare <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/guide/?page_id=16" title="Thematic demo site">old</a> vs new. I reduced the header&rsquo;s thickness and moved the navigation to the top. I
got rid of italicized font and cut down on meta-data displayed for each post. A few dark lines
also make it feel less white and empty.</p>

<p>I tried to implement this redesign with Django instead of WordPress for no reason other than
wanting to play with the Python-based framework. Bad idea. Although I finished the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" title="Writing your first Django app part 1">Django app
walkthrough</a>, Django confused me with its project-app distinction, file hierarchy, and
templating system. Having done Rails and feeling like RoR just clicked for me, Django was a
frustrating experience. On top of that, live deployment on a LAMP stack was excruciating. Can
someone explain to me why Django deals with static and media assets in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/" title="Django Managing static files">this way</a>? <code>sudo
a2enmod mod_python</code>, right? But wait â€“ I&rsquo;m <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3319585/553994" title="Stack Overflow mod-wsgi-mod-python-or-just-cgi">supposed to use mod_wsgi</a>?</p>

<p>After making painstakingly slow progress over the course of a day, I gave up and came crawling
back to WordPress. Despite the <a href="http://kevinjohngallagher.com/2012/01/wordpress-has-left-the-building/" title="Wordpress has left the building">grumbling against it</a> and its security flaws (why put sensitive
files under the document root?), WordPress is used by so many sites ranging from <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/09/03/inside-peek-how-the-new-york-times-uses-blogs/" title="Inside peek: How The New York Times uses blogs">The New York
Times</a> to <a href="https://tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/wp-login.php" title="TechCrunch WordPress login">TechCrunch</a> because of a single overwhelming reason: <strong>it just works</strong>.
Five-minute installation, production-hardened, no-sysadmin-required.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/" title="Thematic, A WordPress Theme Framework">Thematic theme</a> for a long time now. I love it&rsquo;s clean and simple design,
but I wanted to fine-tune it. Unfortunately, I had to spend a couple of days extensively modifying
the theme&rsquo;s core code. I tried to do it with a child theme and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Hooks.2C_Actions_and_Filters" title="Wordpress Hooks, Actions and Filters">hooks, actions, and filters</a>,
but it became ugly fast. So I just duplicated the theme and directly messed with it. The downside
is this theme cannot be shipped; the upside is that it&rsquo;s truly unique to me.</p>
