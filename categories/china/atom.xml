    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2010/07/chinese-propaganda-vs-us-propaganda</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China&rsquo;s Xinhua News Agency started a 24-hour English-language news channel and is about to open a
new office in New York City, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?_r=1&amp;hp">according to the </a><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?_r=1&amp;hp">Times</a></em>. The <em>Times</em> is once again
critical of China. And they should be. China ranks 168th out of 175 countries in the 2009
<a href="http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&amp;id_rubrique=1001">Press Freedom Index</a>, a survey compiled by <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a>. What I don&rsquo;t like
about the <em>Times</em> article is its prejudicial sense of nationalism and simplistic view of East vs
West.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> inflated the article by making it sound as if Xinhua Red Guards wielding hammers and
sickles are about to kick down the sacred doors of Western media companies.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><blockquote><p>On Thursday, an official with Xinhua, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to talk to the press, said Xinhua was planning to build a newsroom at the top of a
44-story skyscraper in Times Square, giving it an address in the same neighborhood as Reuters,
Conde Nast, News Corp and The New York Times.</p><footer><strong>New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>The agency already has more than 10,000 employees and 120 bureaus around the world, rivaling the
  reach, if not the quality, of Western news services like Reuters or Bloomberg.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the US currently has six broadcast operations comparable to China&rsquo;s own
propaganda mouthpieces: Voice of America, Radio Free Europe which targets Eastern Europe, Radio
Sawa and Al Hurra which focus on the Middle East, and Radio Marti on Cuba. Many of these have been
accused of dishing out propaganda rather than balanced reporting. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_america#VOA_as_a_propaganda_tool">here</a>, Lee Bollinger&rsquo;s
book <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3OQvTPTkCsWAlAfz8uGkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Uninhibited, Robust, and Wide-open</a></em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3OQvTPTkCsWAlAfz8uGkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> </a>page 102, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_hurra#Criticisms_of_Alhurra">here</a>. You&rsquo;ve probably never
heard of these media outlets. I hadn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s because they direct their news outwards to citizens
of other countries in an effort to combat local anti-American rhetoric and try to win the native
people&rsquo;s hearts and minds. Taking these federally financed media operations into account with the
<em>Times</em> article about Xinhua, things suddenly aren&rsquo;t so black and white.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> reported that the Chinese government has spent lots of money expanding their
state-controlled TV stations and newspapers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Xinhua&rsquo;s move is just one of several planned by Beijing. China Central Television, the country&rsquo;s
  biggest state-run television broadcaster, has also been expanding overseas and offering broadcasts
  in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and other languages. And China has heavily financed a makeover
  of China Daily, its English-language daily newspaper, and introduced a new English edition of
  Global Times, which is controlled by People&rsquo;s Daily, the leading Communist Party-run newspaper.</p></blockquote>

<p>Astounding fact: &ldquo;the various US government-sponsored international broadcast
channels&hellip;collectively received $671 million in government funds in 2008″ (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Uninhibited</a></em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">, 102</a>).</p>

<p>I wonder how much China&rsquo;s government has allocated to their state-sponsored broadcast
channels&hellip;Perhaps the <em>Times</em> should&rsquo;ve made a comparison not between Xinhua and privately-owned
media companies but between Xinhua and US-sponsored media outlets.</p>

<p>I can see why the <em>Times</em> portrayed the story this way. I don&rsquo;t know if they still have a hiring
freeze, but the media industry&rsquo;s financial pain is only increasing these days. They see a media
company with little press freedom and sense of public accountability funded by a rising economic
albeit authoritarian government setting up shop in their backyard. I&rsquo;d be scared.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been talk of turning media companies into non-profits. For the better half of the 20th
century, corporate board rooms have sucked profit from newspapers instead of plowing them back
into the business. Just another instance of short-term gain overpowering long-term prudence and
stewardship. Now with newsrooms eviscerated from rounds of buyouts, some journalists and editors
are thinking of alternate financial models: 501(3)c non-profits, money from foundations,
tax-deductible donations, and even government funding allocated by independent bodies (like the
National Institutes of Health handing out grants for biomedical research). I point you to a report
called <em><a href="http://www.cjr.org/reconstruction/the_reconstruction_of_american.php?page=all">The Reconstruction of American Journalism</a>.</em></p>

<p>The ultimate irony to the <em>Times</em> story is that journalism in the US could eventually be funded in
such a way that the federal government plays a big role in propping them up. Some journalists balk
at the idea while others are holding their noses while considering it.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, I point you to the 2010 White House Correspondents Dinner.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>People say to me, &ldquo;Mr. President. You helped revive the banking industry. You&rsquo;ve saved GM and
Chrysler. What about the news business?&rdquo; I have to explain, &ldquo;Hey. I&rsquo;m just the President. I&rsquo;m not
a miracle worker here.&rdquo;</p><footer><strong>2010 White House Correspondents Dinner <a href="http://youtu.be/JP5k4n6Wnc4?t=2m46s">http://youtu.be/JP5k4n6Wnc4?t=2m46s</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Weather</h2>

<p>90°F 90% humidity = unbearable feeling of constantly living in a sauna or breathing through a rag.
A short walk to the nearest MTR subway station gives me the pleasant feeling of bathing in my own
perspiration.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Cultural Desert</h2>

<p>Journalist Keyes Beech, who was a foreign correspondent in Asia for five decades and won a
Pulitzer Prize in 1951 for his reporting on the Korean War, wrote in &ldquo;Not Without the Americans,&rdquo;</p>

<p><blockquote><p>For creature comforts, Hong Kong is unsurpassed, but Hong Kong is culturally barren. Living
there is something like living inside a cash register.</p><footer><strong>Keyes Beech</strong> <cite>Not Without the Americans</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>To be fair, HK is a young city with less than 200 years of history, and we should be careful in
how we define &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; whether it be of the high-brow, elitist, avant-garde or the low, vulgar,
and proletarian. But the fact remains that many expats do not seek or expect much from the Big
Lychee beyond cuisine and material goods. In 1996, a survey of tourists by the Hong Kong Tourism
Board suggested many tourists thought there was a dearth of cultural opportunities in HK. Even
Chinese mainlanders, whose traditional culture has been decimated in the last hundred years,
regard their southern, upstart cousins with cultural disdain.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is painfully aware of this perception (it may be just that – perception), and the
government and people have taken steps to remedy the situation. Attitudes toward historical
preservation are shifting towards renovating old buildings instead of flat out demolition, and
preliminary plans have been made for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kowloon_Cultural_District">West Kowloon Cultural District</a>.</p>

<h2>The Language Barrier</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of expats to talk to, but I&rsquo;m unable to communicate on any meaningful level with
the vast majority of the population, from the hotel staff who tidy my room everyday to the Henan
lady at the Stanley Street <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_chaan_teng">cha chaan teng</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m racking my brains over what to say about the <a href="http://www.ani-com.hk/front.htm">Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong 2009</a>
convention because I have never before found myself immersed in something so utterly foreign and
bizarre. The manga fans I know in the States are mere wannabes compared to the 600,000 plus
enthusiasts who flocked to this year&rsquo;s ACGHK sporting imitation M41 carbines, full sets of samurai
armor with matching katanas, and hair of every conceivable unnatural color under the sun.</p>

<p><div class='image left <a'><img  src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2AlBWAaeSqE/TyB8SZ6RsuI/AAAAAAAAAEs/c9O0Ux77X0E/s800/1.jpg">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2AlBWAaeSqE/TyB8SZ6RsuI/AAAAAAAAAEs/c9O0Ux77X0E/s800/1.jpg</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;252&#8221; height=&#8221;378&#8221; title=&#8221;&ldquo;Those are big magazines, if you know what I mean&rdquo; &ldquo;ACGHK cosplay girl with big gun&rdquo;&#8221; ><div class='caption'>&ldquo;Those are big magazines, if you know what I mean&rdquo; &ldquo;ACGHK cosplay girl with big gun&rdquo;</div></div></p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay">Cosplay</a>,&rdquo; short for costume roleplay, is the term for decking yourself out in otherworldly
attire and behave like your favorite animated character. It&rsquo;s not at all dissimilar from the Star
Wars aficionados who dress up as Jedis and storm troopers and Sith lords while waiting hours in
line at the box office. Or the legions of students who, under the spell of Ms. Rowling and the
silver screen, transform themselves from muggles into wizards by donning robes and picking up
Nimbus 2000s.</p>

<p>The ACGHK was held at Hong Kong&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Convention_and_Exhibition_Centre">Convention and Exhibition Center</a>, five stories of concrete
and glass providing 92,000m2 of rentable space, all built in only four years, artificial island
included. Accompanied by two fellow HK interns and a Mormon guy from Utah (another story for
another time), I made my way through cosplayers, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tramboy">tramboys</a>, and prurient photographers.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-V_QTC06FHxU/TyB8SXH3GzI/AAAAAAAAAEs/Kd3Dk4Dtqvo/s800/3.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-V_QTC06FHxU/TyB8SXH3GzI/AAAAAAAAAEs/Kd3Dk4Dtqvo/s800/3.jpg</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;head-to-head fighting game at ACGHK 2009&#8221; ></p>

<p>We saw posters of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon">Doraemon</a>, a wormhole-traveling cat, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda-Z">Panda-Z</a>, a battery-chomping,
robotic panda. Teenage males with permed, red hair took turns going head-to-head in a Street
Fighter-style computer game while friends cheered them on. Across the aisle, Microsoft hired two
women to promote its X-box 360 console– the breasts of one seemed to claw their way out from her
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheongsam">cheongsam</a> like Master Chief busting out of a Pelican dropship.</p>

<p><div class='image right <a'><img  src="href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--c2QoRbV628/TyB8SXeUrNI/AAAAAAAAAEs/ITiuX4_zchg/s800/4.jpg">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/&#8211;c2QoRbV628/TyB8SXeUrNI/AAAAAAAAAEs/ITiuX4_zchg/s800/4.jpg</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; height=&#8221;180&#8221; title=&#8221;Uh, Miss, I think you missed a couple of buttons.&#8221; ><div class='caption'>Uh, Miss, I think you missed a couple of buttons.</div></div></p>

<p>Further into the heart of the convention, stalls sold wooden katanas and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html?em">Grass Mud Horses</a>.
Girls wearing military uniforms of a fashion-conscious Third Reich congregated in corners while
adolescent males stood in circuitous lines for a chance to shake hands with members of a Japanese
girl band called <a href="http://www.scandal-4.com/">Scandal</a>. At least these guys were still making an effort to touch real women.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VyMRtdF6xXc/TyB8SbLamwI/AAAAAAAAAEs/TWdhXwp3WOY/s800/5.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VyMRtdF6xXc/TyB8SbLamwI/AAAAAAAAAEs/TWdhXwp3WOY/s800/5.jpg</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;The f**k your mom horse&#8221; ></p>

<p>At a booth selling T-shirts, a college-aged person explained to me the prevalent Japanese and
Taiwanese influences behind anime and manga. He held up a T-shirt printed with the word &ldquo;Tramboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a guy who spends all his time in his room playing video games and watching anime,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t talk to girls at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The T-shirt seller talked about the near religious fanaticism that anime and manga can induce. It
got me thinking. The line between a strong interest/passion and an unhealthy obsession is rather
fine. Certainly, a strong dependency on an activity and an interest&rsquo;s interference on an individua
&rsquo;s ability to function normally are both necessary criteria. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> are not the only ones who
ve crossed it. Academics to politicians, tech fanboys to football hooligans, philatelists to storm
chasers, all have respective members who&rsquo;ve gone off the deep end.</p>

<p><div class='image center <a'><img  src="href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uIF7L6R332o/TyB8Sclo99I/AAAAAAAAAAA/sutq2bOgasg/s800/6.jpg">http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uIF7L6R332o/TyB8Sclo99I/AAAAAAAAAAA/sutq2bOgasg/s800/6.jpg</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; height=&#8221;375&#8221; title=&#8221;tramboys?&#8221; ><div class='caption'>tramboys?</div></div></p>

<p>I asked the fellow his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reno?&rdquo; I asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reno. As in Reno, Nevada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we walked further into the heart of the convention, robotic cats and pandas gradually
disappeared, anime characters traded cuddliness for curves, and admiration morphed into voyeurism.
Past the convention&rsquo;s heart and deep into its bowels, I paused next to a booth selling four-foot
long pillows whose covers showcased young women in bikinis embracing palm trees with their thighs
so firmly you&rsquo;d think typhoon <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8189466.stm">Morakot</a> was about to make landfall any minute. A middle-aged
gentleman stopped at the booth. He was piqued. He began looking through the pillowcases, and I
felt the excitement at witnessing a member of a fascinating subculture in action only days after
reading a <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26FOB-2DLove-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=asia">article</a> on these so-called 2-D lovers.</p>

<p><div class='image center <a'><img  src="href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TI5z9h8X7KI/AAAAAAAAAmE/z61CpcAINNQ/s800/last.jpg">http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TI5z9h8X7KI/AAAAAAAAAmE/z61CpcAINNQ/s800/last.jpg</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; height=&#8221;375&#8221; title=&#8221;2-D love&#8221; ><div class='caption'>2-D love</div></div></p>

<p>As we exited the convention center, we passed by yet another crowd of photographers swarming
around yet another scantily clad female who elicited flash photography as if the Messiah himself
had just materialized in the flesh. As I walked by, I wondered, &ldquo;Where would a femme fatale like
that holster her Glock? In her garter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><div class='image center <a'><img  src="href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TI5ziyXZvxI/AAAAAAAAAl8/Z75GbERhQpI/s800/8.jpg">http://lh3.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TI5ziyXZvxI/AAAAAAAAAl8/Z75GbERhQpI/s800/8.jpg</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; height=&#8221;375&#8221; title=&#8221;so where do you holster that glock?&#8221; ><div class='caption'>so where do you holster that glock?</div></div></p>

<p>We take our lunch break. By this point everyone is a little tired and, well, see for yourself&hellip;</p>

    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2009/07/getting-away-from-the-machine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a digging machine at a construction site near my workplace in Hong Kong Central. Enormous,
cylindrical, and piston-shaped, it prepares the foundation of a new building on Pedder Street by
driving a sheer metal shaft at least two feet in diameter into hard, raw concrete. When steel
collides with stone, the ground shakes and an ear-splitting clangor pulsates through the air as
the threatening piston trembles and rises to strike again. An auditory manifestation of the city&rsquo;s
pace of development, the piston slams into the ground again and again – a metronome beating out
the urban tempo.</p>

<p><strong><em>Presto</em></strong></p>

<p>The monotonous impacts can be heard from several city blocks away. They create a frenetic rhythm.
Legions of business people, coolies, and restaurant workers dash to and fro. Swarm this way and
that. Point A to point B. They shield their ears. But they can still feel the machine pounding away.
It&rsquo;s under their feet. Reverberating through their legs. Vibrating up their spines. It resonates
beneath their scalps. Within their joints. Deep into the ventricles of their hearts.</p>

<p><strong><em>Allegro</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_peak">Victoria Peak</a> can be reached by taking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Tram">Peak Tram</a> railcar, but the rewarding route is
taken by those who offer their sweat and energy for a communion with nature instead of exchanging
money for air-conditioned comfort in yet another real estate developer&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>At present, in this vicinity, the best part of the land is not private property; the landscape
is not owned, and the walker enjoys comparative freedom. But possibly the day will come when it
will be partitioned off into so-called pleasure-grounds, in which a few will take a narrow and
exclusive pleasure only, – when fences shall be multiplied, and man-traps and other engines
invented to confine men to the <em>public</em> road, and walking over the surface of God&rsquo;s earth shall be
construed to mean trespassing on some gentleman&rsquo;s grounds. To enjoy a thing exclusively is
commonly to exclude yourself from the true enjoyment of it. Let us improve our opportunities, then,
before the evil days to come.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/local-tours/outdoor-dragons-back-taitam.html">Dragon&rsquo;s Back</a> trail is so named because the undulating ups and downs of this path through
hills and valleys makes you think you&rsquo;re treading on the spine of a prostrated beast. The trail is
gentle and gives marvelous views of beaches teeming with sun-seeking leisure goers, yachts making
their way through the South China Sea, and far-flung uninhabited islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Andante</em></strong></p>

<p>The weather on mountaintops is extremely unpredictable. One moment, it&rsquo;s completely sunny with
vistas of towering mountain ranges and vast tracts of sprawling urban centers; the next moment,
you&rsquo;ll find yourself engulfed in rolling plumes of mist and unable to see anything more than several
meters away. As the winds push super humid air up the mountains, temperatures drop and clouds
materialize, hanging mysteriously in fragile formations as the air sweats out its latent water. It
s a wondrously otherworldly experience to walk in these clouds. You feel like you&rsquo;re venturing
through some alternate dimension suspended between heaven and Earth. Look up and all you see is
clouds; look down and even the ground seems to fade from view as the mist swarms around your legs.
Suddenly, a slit opens in the clouds above unleashing a flood of sunlight, and all the mist around
you evaporates just as quickly as it appeared.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adagio</em></strong></p>

<p>After an entire week of crowds, fumes, and fluorescent lights, I retreat to the beaches of Shek O,
the woods of Sai Kung Country Park, or the peaks of Ma On Shan. Here, there&rsquo;s no trace of the
daily grind, urban throngs, or artificial amenities. The mountains are a sanctuary where I get my
weekly fix of solitude, wholesome air, and Mother Nature.</p>

<p><em>I ran out of stuff to say. Shocking, I know. So here&rsquo;s a bunch of photos for your mindless
viewing pleasure.</em></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Life consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence
refreshes him. One who pressed forward incessantly and never rested from his labors, who grew fast
and infinite demands on life, would always find himself in a new country or wilderness, and
surrounded by the raw material of life. He would be climbing over the prostrate stems of primitive
forest-trees.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>For I believe that climate does thus react on man, – as there is something in the mountain-air
that feeds the spirit and inspires. Will not man grow to greater perfection intellectually as well
as physically under these influences?&hellip;I trust that we shall be more imaginative, that our thoughts
will be clearer, fresher, and more ethereal, as our sky, – our understanding more comprehensive
and broader, like our plains, – our intellect generally on a grander scale, like our thunder and
lightning, our rivers and mountains and forests, – and our hearts shall even correspond in breadth
and depth and grandeur to our inland seas.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>&hellip;the natural remedy is to be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day, the
winter to the summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the more air and sunshine in
our thoughts. The callous palms of the laborer are conversant with finer tissues of self-respect
and heroism, whose touch thrills the heart, than the languid fingers of idleness. That is mere
sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from the tan and callus of
experience.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote></p>
