    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2016/04/dont-worry-about-forgetting-to-cancel-your-subscription-use-a-virtual-credit-card</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost all of us have signed up for a free trial we then forgot to cancel
before getting charged for the next month or have felt uneasy entering credit card information
on a sketchy website. I discovered virtual credit card numbers several months ago and now use them
for both these cases.</p>

<p>Virtual credit card numbers (VCN) are credit card numbers that aren&rsquo;t associated with a physical
card. They are usually tied to your regular credit card account, and charges to the VCN will show
up on that credit card statement.</p>

<p>VCNs have two great features on top of regular credit card numbers. <strong>You can set the expiration and
maximum limit can be charged, and you can cancel them at any time.</strong> Let&rsquo;s say I want to try
<a href="https://www.spotify.com/premium/">Spotify Premium</a>. It&rsquo;s free for a month and $10 per month afterwards. I generate a VCN, set the limit
to $1 with an expiration of one month, enter that number into Spotify&rsquo;s website, and forget about
it. Use a VCN when you&rsquo;re wary that an online merchant might steal or is unable to protect your
card info as well.</p>

<p>So how does one get a VCN? The only free and bank-sponsored credit cards I know of that offer
them are <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/accounts-cards/shopsafe.go">Bank of America&rsquo;s ShopSafe feature</a> and <a href="https://www.cardbenefits.citi.com/products/virtual-account-numbers.aspx">Citibank&rsquo;s Virtual Account numbers</a>.
(<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-American-Express-discontinue-their-one-time-use-virtual-credit-card-numbers">Amex seems to have discontinued theirs.</a>)</p>

<p>There are cases when using a VCN might create more hassle than it&rsquo;s worth. The two I can think of
are booking a hotel room and needing to show your card when you arrive in person and returning a
purchase and trying to get a refund.</p>

    <link href="https://www.davidxia.com/2015/05/why-we-should-all-care-about-digital-privacy/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2015/05/why-we-should-all-care-about-digital-privacy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading and thinking a lot about digital privacy in the past two weeks. It&rsquo;s
disconcerting that so many AMericans are resigned about the current state of digital surveillance.
Before the Snowden leaks, one could plausibly deny the vast extent of mass digital surveillance,
but in this post-Snowden era, this is increasingly hard to do without appearing like you live under
a rock.</p>

<p>I recently watched two videos which explain the disturbing extent to which intelligence agencies
like the NSA have gone to subvert encryption algorithms and to sabotage critical Internet
infrastructure. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SgGMj3Mf88" title="Jacob Appelbaum: Reconstructing narratives - transparency in the service of justice [31c3]">this video</a>, Jacob Appelbaum and Laura Poitras talk about how reading
through documents leaked by Snowden has led them to believe the spooks have compromised everything
including PPTP, IPSec, and even SSH. Everything except for PGP (implementations include GnuPG), OTR
(implementions include Pidgin and Adium), and ZRTP (implementations include the Signal and RedPhone
mobile apps).</p>

<iframe class="fill-width" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0SgGMj3Mf88?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The second video I watched was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk" title="NSA operation ORCHESTRA: Annual Status Report">talk by Poul-Henning Kamp</a> in which he pretends
to be an NSA officer giving a status report to NATO. Kamp talks about the various technical and
psychological operations the NSA and its associated intelligence agencies use to collect all
digital communications. I&rsquo;m not sure how much of what Kamp says is true as some parts are
deliberately tongue in cheek, but none of them seem impossible. Here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://youtu.be/fwcl17Q0bpk?t=5m48s">NSA spots a startup</a> that&rsquo;s developing a product that strengthens privacy and thus
makes the NSA&rsquo;s job harder. They send someone who poses as a venture capitalist. He invests money
in the startup and gets insider knowledge on what they&rsquo;re making. NSA looks through their
Rolodex of friendly companies for someone with a patent that&rsquo;s related to the startup&rsquo;s
product. They convince the company to let loose some patent lawyer trolls on the startup. The
startup folds or needs to work on something else under legal duress. The founders call the fake
VC back saying how sorry they were to waste the VC&rsquo;s money. The NSA bites its tongue trying not to
laugh and busts out the champange bottles.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/fwcl17Q0bpk?t=9m47s">Skype&rsquo;s encrypted VoIP product was a threat</a> to the NSA being able to listen in on all telephone
calls. Skype didn&rsquo;t use standard protocols, was closed-source, was outside the jurisdiction of
the FTC, and the NSA couldn&rsquo;t bribe the founders of Skype to stop. So the NSA pressured
eBay to acquire the company which eBay did. But eBay&rsquo;s lawyers bungled the deal and didn&rsquo;t
get access to the source code or control the infrastructure. So the NSA made eBay sell it back
to the founders at a loss. eBay wasn&rsquo;t too happy about this. And then the NSA had to spend a lot
more money making Microsoft acquire Skype. But it was worth it because this time Microsoft got
all of Skype and made the traffic <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data" title="Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages">go through Microsoft servers</a> where it could be decrypted.</li>
<li>How the NSA regularly <a href="https://youtu.be/fwcl17Q0bpk?t=20m19s">derails and slows down open source work</a> by appealing to people&rsquo;s fear,
uncertainty, and doubt; playing the GPL vs BSD card; spawning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality" title="Parkinson's law of triviality">bikeshed discussions</a>; and
soaking up mental bandwidth with bogus crypto proposals.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->




<iframe class="fill-width" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fwcl17Q0bpk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to verify for myself what Appelbaum and Poitras said. There&rsquo;s a lot of discussion on
what the intelligence agencies have cracked and what&rsquo;s still safe. Has the NSA compromised SSH in
general or only in targeted cases? But I wonder if this discussion is useful or if it misses the
point as Kamp inspiringly points out at the end of his talk.</p>

<p>{% blockquote_nobr Poul-Henning Kamp <a href="https://youtu.be/fwcl17Q0bpk?t=30m8s">https://youtu.be/fwcl17Q0bpk?t=30m8s</a> %}
So the standard reaction in the open source environment to Edward Snowden&rsquo;s disclosures have been,
&ldquo;We need to strengthen the protocols! We need to have SSL everywhere.&rdquo; And I think that misses the
point by a large margin. The things that have been published by the Snowden documents by now are
the things that the general public can understand reading their newspaper. The stuff we would be
interested in have not been published and maybe never will. And attempting to add more encryption
is most likely just going to have more broken encryption on the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>This is not a technical problem. This is a political problem. It must be solved by political means.</strong>
That means find politicians in your country who can understand this and make sure they understand
it. If you cannot find politicians, get you some politicians who can understand it. Political will
is a renewable resource. Use your pencil when you vote. Or run yourself.</p>

<p><strong>This is your children&rsquo;s and grandchildren&rsquo;s future society you&rsquo;re looking at. And we&rsquo;re the guys
who sort of missed the boat.</strong>
{% endblockquote_nobr %}</p>

<p>If a guy who&rsquo;s been committing to the FreeBSD kernel for over 15 years says he doesn&rsquo;t see a
technical solution to mass digital surveillance, he&rsquo;s probably got a point. He doesn&rsquo;t see a
technical solution because he cited the enormous amounts of money and manpower intelligence agencies
have compared with the measly resources of open source contributors. The Director of National
Intelligence, the overseer of all US intelligence agencies, requested $53.9 billion for the
National Intelligence Program&rsquo;s budget in 2016. Even if a small portion of that funded domestic spying
programs, that&rsquo;s still a lot of money. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke" title="The World's Email Encryption Software Relies on One Guy, Who is Going Broke">up until recently</a>, Werner Koch who wrote GnuPG,
a crucial piece of the world&rsquo;s encryption software, was struggling to raise just $25,000 a year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to understand why we Americans are either too apathetic or resigned to fight
for our privacy rights. I think it&rsquo;s because digital privacy is hard to understand and it&rsquo;s not
in-your-face spying like finding a camera in your bedroom or a GPS tracker underneath your car.
Some people believe the costs of giving up their privacy is outweighed by the supposed effectiveness
in stopping terrorism. In most of my conversations, people believe domestic spying is wrong
but think resistance is futile. They simply say &ldquo;I have nothing to hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This simple statement is pernicious and damaging to not just civil society as a whole but also
for our future generations. Mass surveillance isn&rsquo;t an individual problem. It&rsquo;s a collective
problem. I don&rsquo;t have anything to hide from the spooks, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m going to give my
government a free pass for spying on its citizens. Just because I&rsquo;m doing well as an individual
doesn&rsquo;t mean I throw the group to which I belong under the bus. We don&rsquo;t live in a vacuum, and
each of our actions or inactions affect those around us.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve drawn a flow chart of my argument of why we should stop mass surveillance below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html" title="upside down ternet">this web page</a> many years ago that described how someone used their unencrypted WiFi
network to prank neighbors by turning all images upside down or making them blurry or simply
redirecting them to cats. I always wanted to do it myself, but I didn&rsquo;t have the required knowledge
or hardware until now.</p>

<p>In <a href="/2015/03/how-to-install-dd-wrt-on-an-asus-rt-n16-router/" title="How to install DD-WRT on on Asus RT-N16 router">my previous post</a>, I wrote about how I installed DD-WRT onto my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00387G6R8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00387G6R8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkId=6TECRA3HNZATDC4U" title="Asus RT-N16">Asus RT-N16 wireless
router</a>. You might be able to do this prank with the factory default firmware for your router.
Your firmware needs to let you do the steps in <a href="http://www.alexlaird.com/2013/03/dd-wrt-guest-wireless/" title="DD-WRT guest wireless">this awesome tutorial</a> to create a separate
guest WiFi network and add custom iptables rules. If it doesn&rsquo;t, get a better router or flash
better firmware.</p>

<p>Install the squid3 proxy caching server on a computer on the LAN using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upside-Down-TernetHowTo" title="Ubuntu Upside down ternet HowTo">this tutorial from
Ubuntu</a>. Instead of using the Apache web server and that Perl script (which didn&rsquo;t work for me),
I used Nginx and wrote an analogous Python script. I skipped their &ldquo;Networking Setup&rdquo; section
because I need to setup iptables rules in my router to redirect all traffic from the guest WiFi to
the squid proxy host. I setup a new subdomain &ldquo;newsubdomain.davidxia.com&rdquo; to point to the
proxy host and added the Nginx configuration for it as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="python Python script for squid url_rewrite_program">#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import subprocess
import sys
import urllib
import uuid


IMG_DIR = '/var/www/images/'
BASE_URL = 'http://newsubdomain.davidxia.com/'


def modify_url(line):
    list = line.split(' ')
    # The first element of the list is the requested URL.
    old_url = list[0]

    # The returned needs to contain a '\n' at the end.
    # A '\n' by itself means do not rewrite the URL.
    new_url = '\n'

    # If the requested URL is a JPG, save it to a file on the proxy host, flip it upside down,
    # and give the user the URL to the upside down image. :p
    if old_url.lower().endswith('.jpg'):
        img_file_name = str(uuid.uuid4()) + '.jpg'
        img_file_path = os.path.join(IMG_DIR, img_file_name)
        try:
            urllib.urlretrieve(old_url, img_file_path)
            subprocess.check_output(['/usr/bin/mogrify', '-flip', img_file_path])
            new_url = BASE_URL + img_file_name + '\n'
        except urllib.ContentTooShortError:
            # TODO log this and return original URL
            pass
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            # TODO log and return original URL and delete the image file
            pass
    return new_url

while True:
    # The format of the line read from stdin is
    # URL ip-address/fqdn ident method, e.g. http://saini.co.in 172.17.8.175/saini.co.in - GET -
    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

    # new_url is a simple URL only, e.g. http://fedora.co.in
    new_url = modify_url(line)
    sys.stdout.write(new_url)
    sys.stdout.flush()
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="plain Nginx config">server {

}
</code></pre>

<p>In the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upside-Down-TernetHowTo#Configuration" title="Ubuntu Upside down ternet HowTo - configuration">squid configuration section</a>, be sure to have <code>acl localnet src &lt;network range&gt;</code> where
<code>network range</code> is 192.168.2.1/24 if you used the aforementioned tutorial. Make sure you can
make HTTP requests to the proxy on localhost:3128 in order to debug. If you can&rsquo;t, you might need to
add extra ACL rules to the squid conf file (something like <code>http_access allow localnet</code>).</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Squid_Transparent_Proxy#Proxy_Server_on_the_LAN_Subnet" title="squid transparent proxy - proxy server on the LAN subnet">instructions</a> to configure the router&rsquo;s firewall rules but realized my setup
was different. I don&rsquo;t want to proxy traffic from my regular WiFi subnet 192.168.1.1/24 to my proxy
host on 192.168.1.134 but instead from 192.168.2.1/24 to 192.168.1.134. Use these rules:</p>

<pre><code class="plain iptables rules for router"># Allow traffic coming into interface br0 from proxy host 192.168.1.134 to exit interface br1 to any destination IP
iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br1 -s 192.168.1.134 -j ACCEPT

# Allow traffic coming into interface br1 from any IP to exit interface br1 to proxy host 192.168.1.134
# make stricter later
iptables -I FORWARD -i br1 -o br0 -d 192.168.1.134 -j ACCEPT

PROXY_IP=192.168.1.134
PROXY_PORT=3128
LAN_IP=`nvram get br1_ipaddr`
LAN_NET=$LAN_IP/`nvram get br1_netmask`

# Modify the destination address of packets as soon as they come in.
# Change their destination address to the squid proxy on 192.168.1.134:3128.
# Only change packets matching these criteria: came into the br1 interface, are TCP packets, destined for port 80.
# This redirects HTTP traffic from the guest WiFi to the squid proxy.
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to $PROXY_IP:$PROXY_PORT

# Modify the destination address of packets as they are about to go out.
# Change their destination address to the br1 interface's IP, ie the virtual Wifi's router IP of 192.168.2.1.
# Only change packets matching these criteria: leaving the br1 interface, have a source address
# from the 192.168.2.1/24 subnet, are TCP packets, destined for the proxy IP.
# This makes the squid proxy return HTTP requests back to the guest Wifi, I think...
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o br1 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp -j SNAT --to $LAN_IP

# Allow traffic coming into the br1 interface and leaving br0 with a source IP from the guest WiFi.
# Packets have to be TCP and destined for the squid proxy's port.
iptables -I FORWARD -i br1 -o br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp --dport $PROXY_PORT -j ACCEPT
</code></pre>

<p>Result!</p>

    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2015/03/how-to-install-dd-wrt-on-an-asus-rt-n16-router</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve known about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT" title="DD-WRT">DD-WRT</a> for a while and always wanted to play with it (partly because I
thought it was needed to do <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html" title="upside down ternet">this prank of turning the Internet upside down</a>).
My router is leased from Time Warner and probably not supported by DD-WRT.
So I bought an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00387G6R8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00387G6R8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkId=6TECRA3HNZATDC4U" title="Asus RT-N16">Asus RT-N16 router</a> and learned how to flash DD-WRT firmware onto it. The process
was easier than I expected but required me to read a lot and be careful.
I sifted through mazes of documentation, blog posts, and forum threads to find the most recent
and correct ones. I was afraid of bricking my brand new $100 Asus, but I succeeded.
Here&rsquo;s how you can too.</p>

<h2>What is DD-WRT and why would you install it?</h2>

<p>DD-WRT is open-source Linux-based firmware that can replace and enhance the factory default
firmware on many wireless routers. Once you install it, you can SSH, overclock the CPU, setup
advanced access restrictions, change the firewall, etc.</p>

<h2>How to install DD-WRT onto an Asus RT-N16 wireless router</h2>

<p>Follow <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Asus_RT-N16" title="DD-WRT's installation guide for Asus RT-N16">this guide written specifically for the Asus RT-N16</a> and
flash the initial firmware <a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2010/08-12-10-r14929/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini_RT-N16.trx" title="DD-WRT initial firmware">dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini_RT-N16.trx</a>

Then in step 7, flash the <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_DD-WRT%3F#K2.6_Build_Features" title="DD-WRT K2.6 build features">dd-wrt.v24-18024_NEWD-2_K2.6_mega</a> build
to get most of the features.</p>

<p>Read everything carefully and make sure to follow all the steps. If you open your router&rsquo;s web UI
and see the below, give yourself a pat on the back.</p>

<h2>Setup SSH access to router</h2>

<p>Go to the web UI. Click on the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; tab and scroll down to the &ldquo;Secure Shell&rdquo; section.
Enable SSHd and add your SSH public key.</p>

<p>Now you can <code>ssh root@&lt;router's IP&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2>Mount a USB hard drive for network-attached storage</h2>

<p>I quickly discovered, thanks to my colleague Andrey, that the Asus has a read-only file system.
The only way to write anything to it is to mount an external hard disk. Luckily USB disks are
cheap, this can act as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage" title="network-attached storage">file server/network-attached storage</a>, and it&rsquo;s easy to do.</p>

<p>I bought a ~$25 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RB0P2I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007RB0P2I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkId=OS37UXM3XSWIXCR5" title="SanDisk Cruzer Glide USB 64GB Flash Drive">64GB Sandisk USB</a>. The first step is to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_-_Format_and_Partition_External_Storage_Device" title="How To - Format And Partition External Storage Device">format and partition</a> it
(<a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_-_Format_and_Partition_External_Storage_Device#Linux_Command_Line_Method_.28preferred.29" title="How To - Format And Partition External Storage Device: Linux Command Line Method (preferred)">I used a Linux machine</a>). I didn&rsquo;t create the &ldquo;jffs&rdquo; partition because I had a USB instead of
a multimedia card or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;.</p>

<p>{% img_caption center <a href="http://www.hacker9.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/How-to-recover-lost-password-of-Memory-Card-MMC-micro-SD-adapter.jpg">http://www.hacker9.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/How-to-recover-lost-password-of-Memory-Card-MMC-micro-SD-adapter.jpg</a> 215 235 example MMC %}</p>

<p>Plug the USB into the Asus router and follow <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/USB_storage#USB_Guide_for_v24_and_v24SP1_Mega_of_DD-WRT" title="USB storage - USB Guide for v24 and v24SP1 Mega of DD-WRT">these steps here</a>. You&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve mounted the
USB correctly when you can <code>touch /opt/test</code> if <code>/opt</code> was your mount point.</p>

<h2>Install extra software using ipkg</h2>

<p>For someone who&rsquo;s used to advanced shells like <a href="http://fishshell.com/" title="fish shell">fish</a> and zsh, I was sad to see I was
always root (is there a way to create more user accounts?) running sh. There&rsquo;s vi but no vim,
no <code>--help</code> or man pages for commands, and not even error messages (you have to <code>echo $?</code>). So I
followed <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/USB_storage#Option_6.2_-_Extra_software_the_Optware_way" title="USB storage - extra software the optware way">these steps</a> to install ipkg, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipkg" title="Wikipedia ipkg">Itsy Package Management System</a>, into <code>/opt</code>.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t bother creating <code>/opt/etc/profile</code>. I just use <code>ipkg-opt</code> instead of the built-in <code>ipkg</code>,
and things seem to work. I installed the following packages:</p>

<pre><code>root@DD-WRT:~# ipkg-opt list_installed
ipkg-opt - 0.99.163-10 - The Itsy Package Manager
ncurses - 5.7-3 - NCurses libraries
uclibc-opt - 0.9.28-13 - micro C library for embedded Linux systems
vim - 7.3-2 - Yet another version of the vi editor.
Successfully terminated.
</code></pre>

<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this, I see that ipkg has been discontinued and that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opkg" title="Wikipedia opkg">opkg</a> supersedes it.
I haven&rsquo;t tried out opkg yet.</p>

<p>The background behind the limited functionality of DD-WRT&rsquo;s operating system is that it&rsquo;s built on
top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox" title="Wikipedia BuxyBox">BusyBox</a>, a single executable providing a very stripped-down version of Linux.
BusyBox was specifically created for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_operating_system" title="Wikipedia embedded operating systems">embedded operating systems</a>.</p>

<h2>Known bugs in DD-WRT v24-sp2 mega revision 18024</h2>

<ul>
<li>the router&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=148539&amp;sid=d550bc235bccd0ea8593df413c3439b7" title="New official dd-wrt build - 18024 is out (BS)">SSH keys change everytime it reboots</a></li>
<li>NAT loopback doesn&rsquo;t work. I worked around it with the iptables rules below.</li>
</ul>


<pre><code>insmod ipt_mark
insmod xt_mark
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i ! `get_wanface` -d `nvram get wan_ipaddr` -j MARK --set-mark 0xd001
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -m mark --mark 0xd001 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.alexlaird.com/2013/04/dd-wrt-nat-loopback-issue/" title="DD-WRT NAT loopback issue">explained here</a> where the writer claims allowing NAT loopback doesn&rsquo;t make your
internal network less secure. I think the reason for the disabled NAT loopback is to prevent
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding" title="Wikipedia DNS rebinding">DNS rebinding attacks</a>. This DefCon talk by Craig Heffner explains it nicely.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an option to enable &ldquo;No DNS rebind&rdquo; in DD-WRT though. Maybe that prevents this
vulnerability?</p>
