  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>THE PISS</strong></p>

<p>Imagine finding <strong>22 bottles of fetid piss</strong> in a college dorm room. Like any well-adjusted human
being, you&rsquo;re probably having a hard time. I&rsquo;ll help.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TipplOoTzoE/TyB8SZ9EnOI/AAAAAAAAAAA/V48iYbq_5-s/s800/2.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="22 bottles of piss" ></p>

<!--more-->


<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, <strong>&ldquo;But some of that could be apple juice.&rdquo;</strong> Nope. I checked.</p>

<p><strong>THE BACKGROUND STORY</strong></p>

<p>In my sophomore year at Columbia University, I lived in a doughnut-shaped building called McBain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/StjDZWZmkoI/AAAAAAAAANo/uf3UUhXelGI/s400/Picture-1.png" title="McBane" ></p>

<p>I call it McBane because:</p>

<ul>
<li>on weekends drunk students urinated from the top floors into the bottom of the shaft</li>
<li>people throwing garbage into the shaft turned it into a giant trash compost.</li>
</ul>


<p>One day, I walked to my friend&rsquo;s corner walk-through double. Due some type of mixup (no doubt
involving our wonderful <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/housing/index.html">Columbia Housing department</a>), he got stuffed into a double with a
stranger. His roommate was beyond strange.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/StjLABs5e4I/AAAAAAAAANs/DXZ3hj1H4gc/s800/mcbane-floor-plan.jpg" title="My friend got the better end of the deal. He got the big room at ~200 ft², while his roommate was handed the windowed closet at ~100ft²." alt="McBane floor plan"><div class='caption'>My friend got the better end of the deal. He got the big room at ~200 ft², while his roommate was handed the windowed closet at ~100ft².</div></div>


<p><strong>THE BOTTLES</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll call this kid Howard Hughes, for 22 reasons that have already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes#Mental_illness_and_physical_decline">been made as clear</a> as
semester-old piss. Hughes left behind a nice present for housing to clean up – <strong>rancid urine
meticulously stored in</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>7x Powerade bottles</li>
<li>4x 1.5L Dr. Peppers</li>
<li>3x Ocean Spray raspberry juice containers</li>
<li>some Nalgenes</li>
<li>a Minutemaid orange juice bottle</li>
<li>2x 40oz malt liquor bottles</li>
<li>a Natural Light aluminum can</li>
<li>an regular old plastic cup filled to the brim</li>
<li>etc.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TipplOoTzoE/TyB8SZ9EnOI/AAAAAAAAAAA/V48iYbq_5-s/s800/2.jpg" title="bottles of urine" ></p>

<p>To the untrained eye this is just <strong>22 reasons to retch</strong>, but to the scrupulous observer
carefully enough to breathe through his mouth, these bottles tell a story. Their relative age can
be deduced. Rich amber colored urine that is clear is fresher, while apple-cider gold with a
bottom layer of coagulated sediment is, shall we say, <em>aged</em>. The average human adult produces 1-2
L of urine per day. My conservative estimate of the urine volume in Hughe&rsquo;s room is 15L. This
means it took him at least eight days to pump out all this juice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure housing fined his ass to the maximum extent.</p>

<p><strong>THE MOTIVE</strong></p>

<p>As you can see from the floor plan below,</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iK7Mp-Mojh4/TyB8Sdfz15I/AAAAAAAAAEs/Gnfr6ebwEjE/s640/footprints.jpg" width="522" height="440" title="the bathroom is not that far away" ></p>

<p>Hughes&#8217; room was no more than 20 feet from the restroom. I could understand if he lived 40 feet
from the urinals. This leads us to ask the inevitable question &ldquo;<strong>WHY?</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why fill up 22 containers with urine?</strong> Was he extremely lazy or was it some sick joke on his
roommate and housing at the end of the year? A nice F<strong>k-you send-off present. Maybe, based on
this incriminating photograph, of the bottle pipe on his shelf, he was just </strong>stoned**. F.Y.I.
After doing some cursory research, I have found that tenacious people have created extremely
innovative ways to get high:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TJflJHzCP8I/AAAAAAAAAqg/wswsSWuRZBM/s800/3.jpg" title="bottles of urine" ></p>

<iframe class="fill-width youtube-player" type="text/html" width="522" height="416"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9qyjuuJHpk" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>But I digress. So what is the motive? Drug screenings? But even the most suspected MLB players
didn&rsquo;t need to do that many screenings. There is probably some truth to this story out there, but
most of us couldn&rsquo;t give a cup of piss about it. In the meantime, here are some more pictures for
your viewing pleasure:</p>
