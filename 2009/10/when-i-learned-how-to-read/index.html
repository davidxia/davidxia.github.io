  <div class="entry-content"><p>The memory of when I first learned how to read glows like in my mind like embers still hot from
their initial spark. I was in kindergarten. There were 26 big workbooks. One for every letter of
the alphabet. The characters were Jack, Jill, their dog, a lion, and a silly troll that hid under
a bridge. They lived in a world of bright colors and simple shapes.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The letters we learned by tracing and copying over and over again in the workbook&rsquo;s pages
inhabited a parallel universe delineated by two horizontal, solid lines and neatly bisected into
northern and southern hemispheres by a dotted equator. This monosyllabic realm of simple sentences
was a very different one from that of the pictures above them. The pictures with their contrasting
colors and crisply defined forms were immediately accessible. All I had to do was look and I could
tell that Jack was walking, the dog was running, or that the troll was up to his usual tricks again.
The letters, on the other hand, were monochrome, static, and boring. They floated orderly along
in a horizontal matrix like cellular bodies pulsing through an artery delivering packets of
information, but all of it was unintelligible to me. I had no idea how to navigate the individual
letters, how to string them together in my mind to make create words, how to use these words to
construct sentences that conveyed reasoning and sentiments.</p>

<p>One day the teacher asked us to go up to her one by one and demonstrate our ability to read a few
sentences from the workbooks. I was one of the last to go, and as I watched each additional kid
pass the test with relative ease, I became more anxious. The page with its seemingly random black
markings was unwilling to speak to me. I remember feeling dumb and left out afterwards with only
my frustration and disappointment to keep me company.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it suddenly clicked and everything made sense, but I remember the tremendous
elation and clarity that followed. The letters began to coalesce into familiar objects and actions.
A &ldquo;J&rdquo; preceding an &ldquo;a&rdquo; and a &ldquo;c&rdquo; concluding with in &ldquo;k&rdquo; became Jill&rsquo;s companion. The &ldquo;d&rdquo;
followed by an &ldquo;o&rdquo; and ending in a &ldquo;g&rdquo; turned into man&rsquo;s best friend. A world once sealed was now
cracked wide open and its secrets were revealed and unfurled. The horizon&rsquo;s vanishing point was
swept out much farther revealing unimagined distances and landscapes, and a parallel universe
suddenly exploded and surged through my own reality. Words acquired real sense and meaning for me
now, and in time I developed a strange tenderness for their appearances and sounds. My eyes
lingered in the bowl of the &ldquo;g,&rdquo; slid down the spur of the &ldquo;a,&rdquo; and poked into the apertures of
the &ldquo;m.&rdquo; My tongue glided over diphthongs, darted to pelt out aspirations, and froze for glottal
stops. I relished onomatopoeias, portmanteaus, and loanwords and garnered the obscure – aglet,
macaronic, etc.</p>

<p>Everyday after lunch, every child received a foam mat, tables and chairs were pushed to the sides
of the room, and every kid staked out their own little napping area. I could never fall asleep. I
lay on my mat, stared around the room, made noises, disturbed peaceful slumberers, and played with
whatever was in reach – dust bunnies and unpopped popcorn kernels from story time were only a few.
As punishment, the teachers relocated me to a corner of the room where the bookshelves were located.
They oriented the three bookshelves so that they created a U-shape and told me this was my
special napping place from that point on. The penalty was essentially banishment to a cordoned off
space where I would no longer be able to bother others, but as far as I was concerned, this was
the best thing that could have happened to me at naptime. While the lights were off, shades were
drawn, and the sound of slow, rhythmic breathing emanated from twenty small noses throughout the
room, I perused book after book. When the lights were turned on, mats put away, and the snacks
brought out, I would still be lost on a certain page trying to figure out an unfamiliar word or
staring mesmerized by a rich illustration. Although the little nook&rsquo;s actual size was no bigger
than one mat, for me it was a limitless place.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r4B2GLVKkAk/TyB8SSHWRdI/AAAAAAAAAEs/7IIzZpvgCOg/s400/3.jpg" width="344" height="400" title="Caps for Sale" ></p>

<p>From the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375842144?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375842144">Berenstain Bears</a></em>, I learned about the danger in consuming an excessive amount of
television and junk food. From <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399250395?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399250395">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399218858?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399218858">The Very Quiet Cricket</a></em>,
I was shown the power of transformation and the hope of change. If I was not in the best of moods,
I would reach for <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416985956?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416985956">Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</a></em> and reassure
myself I was at least doing better than Alex. I took delight in the antics and follies of primates
by reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064433137?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0064433137">Caps for Sale</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618154248?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0618154248">Curious George</a></em>. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140501827?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0140501827">The Snowy Day</a></em> testified to the
majestic quality of the world around me, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064430227?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0064430227">Harold and the Purple Crayon</a></em> showed me the
magic of creation. In my small bookshelf corner, everything was made new again and instilled with
wonder.</p>

<p>But as I delved more and more into the world of letters and books, I found myself pulling away
from another sphere. Everyday the teachers handed out the mats, and everyday I would eagerly
retire to my bookshelf corner and be enclosed within its walls, separating me from the other kids
who all dozed away. Instead of running around with other kids at sleepover camps during the summer,
I explored the local ponds and parks in solitude and tried to spot orioles and red-tailed hawks
while clutching my copy of the Audubon Society&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679428526?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0679428526">Field Guide to North American Birds</a></em>. I
learned how to make buttermilk and the importance of hard work from
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064400409?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0064400409">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>, but I was not able to join in an argument with my classmates
over who was the best batter in the Boston Red Sox.</p>

<p>Memories of the first time I learned how to read are intertwined closely with recollections of the
first time I discovered the companionship of books – of how they can educate, entertain, and
sometimes even comfort – and the first time I felt isolated from other human beings. When the
lights came on and the mats were put away, I would still be in my corner nook flipping through
<em>Harold and the Purple Crayon</em>. I would eventually get up and join the other kids, but I would
always look forward to the next day&rsquo;s naptime.</p>
