  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like all the Mexicans in New York City just stopped working one day,&rdquo; said CEO Intern D as I
was walking with him in HK Central one Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>His comparison seems apt, so just suspend your PC-sense for a minute while I run with the analogy.
Imagine every Sunday all the Mexicans in NYC with low-skilled jobs (We don&rsquo;t have to pick on only
the Mexicans. Take the Pakistani cabbies, Chinese restaurant owners, <em>insert your favorite ethnic
stereotype here</em>) stop working, go to Wall Street or Times Square, and just throw one big street
party. Imagine they hawk goods, snack on Mexican food, play cards with friends, sit on picnic
blankets on shaded sidewalk areas, and just generally have a rockin&#8217; fun time without giving a
shit about the disapproving stares and upturned noses of white passersby.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Imagine that and you&rsquo;ll have a pretty good picture of the scene in HK every Sunday when the
majority of the city&rsquo;s domestic laborers take the day off. These laborers, officially called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_domestic_helpers_in_Hong_Kong#History">foreign domestic helpers (FDH)</a>, are predominantly Filipino or Indonesian and overwhelmingly
female. HKers employ them to cook, clean, and take care of their kids. Sure, folks in the US hire
maids and babysitters, but FDHs have been institutionalized into HK&rsquo;s very fabric of life.
Unfortunately, the prevalence of FDHs has created some vexing socioeconomic/ethnic problems.</p>

<p>FDHs make up 3% (> 220,000) of HK&rsquo;s population. More than half are Filipino, over 40% Indonesian,
and the rest Southeast Asians. FDHs are essentially live-in maids who work six days a week for
their employers. On their day off, since they don&rsquo;t have their own houses, they pick a spot in the
streets of HK and meet up with friends. The mass exodus is spontaneously coordinated so that
certain ethnicities claim certain parts of HK. Filipinos take to Central, Indonesians congregate
along the island&rsquo;s waterfront, and South Asians make themselves home in Kowloon&rsquo;s Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-56ilrnJAFPI/TyB8SRUbhiI/AAAAAAAAAEs/t1Oj5YUjJF8/s500/1.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="Filipinos in Central" ><div class='caption'>Filipinos in Central</div></div>


<p>In <em><a href="http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=08P_zzYfphYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=maid-to-order-in-hong-kong&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1">Maid to Order in Hong Kong</a></em>, Nicole Constable describes domestic work&rsquo;s evolution in HK,
today&rsquo;s FDH system, employers&#8217; exploitation of their female laborers, and FDH&rsquo;s resistance against
their employers. It&rsquo;s not exactly a page-turner, but Constable has done thorough research and
presents a wealth of statistical evidence and personal stories.</p>

<p>On June 25th, a proposed minimum wage law excluding FDHs caused some <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=83983&amp;sid=24342721&amp;con_type=3">controversy</a>, but the
tensions existed long before that. There have been reports of FDHs suffering physical and sexual
abuse from their employers, debate on whether Filipino maids should be allowed to gather in
Central on Sundays, uproar over a <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sjkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5298,3567512">children&rsquo;s doll</a> manufactured with a Philippine passport and
work contract as accessories, and the occasional allegation that a maid has spiked her boss&#8217; meal
with <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=84901&amp;sid=24580949&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090716&amp;sear_year=2009">menstrual blood</a>.</p>

<p>From what I know so far, the Filipino and Indonesian economies aren&rsquo;t as strong as HK&rsquo;s, so many
women from these two countries become domestic workers abroad in order to earn more money than
they could back home. Indeed, one common argument against the passage of legislation favorable to
FDHs is that they&rsquo;re already being treated very well in HK and wouldn&rsquo;t choose to work here if the
money didn&rsquo;t compensate them. Although some Filipino and Indonesian women might view the prospect
of being a HK FDH at first as a wonderful opportunity, becoming a maid in a foreign country is not
always solely their choice nor do they have complete knowledge of the fantastic working conditions
they can look forward to.</p>

<p>Filipino and Indonesian women are often pressured by their families to work abroad and send
remittances back home so that father can buy some land or little sis can go to university like she
always dreamed. A whole entire industry has sprung up to accommodate HK&rsquo;s demand for foreign
domestic labor. There are FDH agencies operating on both sides to broker deals between prospective
employers and employees. Unfortunately, the odds are frequently stacked against the employees who
have less regulatory protection and receive little, if any, background info on their employers or
disclosures about the nightmarish immigration process that burdens them with fees and restrictions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s astounding how much the Philippine economy depends on FDH remittances. According to Constable,</p>

<blockquote><p>By 2003 remittances reached US$7.6 billion dollars a year, approximately 10 percent of the gross
domestic product. According to the Asian Migrant Centre, the average migrant worker supports five
people at home, and one out of every five Filipinos directly depends on migrant workers&#8217; earnings.</p><footer><strong>Nicole Constable</strong> <cite>Maid to Order in Hong Kong</cite></footer></blockquote>




<div class='image center'><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3lVDuhCYqZ4/TyB8ScLmKhI/AAAAAAAAAEs/ikt9l9CQcfc/s800/3735383310_db8d2f28b8.jpg" width="375" height="500" title="&#34;If you are still scratching your head wondering what the hell I'm talking about, let me spell it out for you: it's like HK's economy is built on top of these FDHs.&#34; HSBC on top of FDHs" alt="&#34;If you are still scratching your head wondering what the hell I'm talking about, let me spell it out for you: it's like HK's economy is built on top of these FDHs.&#34; HSBC on top of FDHs"><div class='caption'>&#34;If you are still scratching your head wondering what the hell I&#8217;m talking about, let me spell it out for you: it&#8217;s like HK&#8217;s economy is built on top of these FDHs.&#34; HSBC on top of FDHs</div></div>


<p>The whole FDH situation is tainted with overt racism. Domestic chores in HK used to be done by
Chinese servants, but now people are associating foreign workers&#8217; darker skin color with a
penchant for scrubbing dishes. Some HK kids even refer to their FDH as &ldquo;my Filipino.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic Filipino maids are often highly educated, sometimes more so than their employers.
Constable cites a study indicating almost 50 percent of all domestic workers had a high school
education, and an additional 38 percent had attended college or university. But their economy sucks,
and now their diplomas go towards mopping the floor.</p>

<p>FDHs face ridiculous restrictions on their behavior such as when/how often/how long to take
showers and wash their hair to not being able to wear dresses or putting on lipstick while working.</p>

<p>To Constable, all of these restrictions are methods of control. Constable&rsquo;s a big fan of Michel
Foucault&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish">Discipline and Punish</a></em> and applies a lot of his theories on power and discipline
to the employer-FDH relationship (I guess Contemporary Civilization is useful after all).</p>

<p>A lot of the strife between employers and employees stems from HK employers&#8217; lack of cultural
sensitivity. Constable recounts stories about how maids are forced to prepare pork when they might
be Muslim (and hence forbidden from eating our curly-tailed friends) to taking showers at night
when they believe this causes the body to be more susceptible to
illness.</p>

<p>Constable stresses, however, that FDHs are not all passive, helpless, and docile. Filipinos are
increasingly getting street-smart about the whole life-as-maid-in-HK situation (a reason why hires
of Indonesian women, who don&rsquo;t know the ropes of HK as well, are skyrocketing), and many are not
shy about protesting, standing up to their employers, or disobeying rules. They join FDH support
networks and organizations that lobby the government and provide support for its members. They&rsquo;ll
sue their employers for cheating them out of their money or being abusive. They aren&rsquo;t allowed to
hawk goods on the street, but many do so anyways, and when they are caught by police, they pretend
they&rsquo;re giving a birthday gift to their customer and the surrounding crowd plays along nonchalantly.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NhREtEz9Drg/TyB8ScnCCnI/AAAAAAAAAEs/A2dZBt_wGI0/s800/3735383476_b17793b984.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="s native language" alt="No hawking or littering in Tagalog"><div class='caption'>s native language</div></div>


<p>Of course, not all FDH-employer relationships are unsavory. Some develop very warm, close ties to
their host family, but these are the exceptions to the rule. Both in HK and in the home countries,
migrant female domestic labor has created some downright difficult socioeconomic conundrums.
Troubles, however, seem to dissipate on Sundays when the streets fill up with chattering, lively
women who, for this one day at least, make the city their own.</p>
