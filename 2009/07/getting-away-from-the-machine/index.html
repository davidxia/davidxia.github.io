  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s a digging machine at a construction site near my workplace in Hong Kong Central. Enormous,
cylindrical, and piston-shaped, it prepares the foundation of a new building on Pedder Street by
driving a sheer metal shaft at least two feet in diameter into hard, raw concrete. When steel
collides with stone, the ground shakes and an ear-splitting clangor pulsates through the air as
the threatening piston trembles and rises to strike again. An auditory manifestation of the city&rsquo;s
pace of development, the piston slams into the ground again and again – a metronome beating out
the urban tempo.</p>

<p><strong><em>Presto</em></strong></p>

<p>The monotonous impacts can be heard from several city blocks away. They create a frenetic rhythm.
Legions of business people, coolies, and restaurant workers dash to and fro. Swarm this way and
that. Point A to point B. They shield their ears. But they can still feel the machine pounding away.
It&rsquo;s under their feet. Reverberating through their legs. Vibrating up their spines. It resonates
beneath their scalps. Within their joints. Deep into the ventricles of their hearts.</p>

<p><strong><em>Allegro</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_peak">Victoria Peak</a> can be reached by taking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Tram">Peak Tram</a> railcar, but the rewarding route is
taken by those who offer their sweat and energy for a communion with nature instead of exchanging
money for air-conditioned comfort in yet another real estate developer&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<blockquote><p>At present, in this vicinity, the best part of the land is not private property; the landscape
is not owned, and the walker enjoys comparative freedom. But possibly the day will come when it
will be partitioned off into so-called pleasure-grounds, in which a few will take a narrow and
exclusive pleasure only, – when fences shall be multiplied, and man-traps and other engines
invented to confine men to the *public* road, and walking over the surface of God&#8217;s earth shall be
construed to mean trespassing on some gentleman&#8217;s grounds. To enjoy a thing exclusively is
commonly to exclude yourself from the true enjoyment of it. Let us improve our opportunities, then,
before the evil days to come.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/local-tours/outdoor-dragons-back-taitam.html">Dragon&rsquo;s Back</a> trail is so named because the undulating ups and downs of this path through
hills and valleys makes you think you&rsquo;re treading on the spine of a prostrated beast. The trail is
gentle and gives marvelous views of beaches teeming with sun-seeking leisure goers, yachts making
their way through the South China Sea, and far-flung uninhabited islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Andante</em></strong></p>

<p>The weather on mountaintops is extremely unpredictable. One moment, it&rsquo;s completely sunny with
vistas of towering mountain ranges and vast tracts of sprawling urban centers; the next moment,
you&rsquo;ll find yourself engulfed in rolling plumes of mist and unable to see anything more than several
meters away. As the winds push super humid air up the mountains, temperatures drop and clouds
materialize, hanging mysteriously in fragile formations as the air sweats out its latent water. It
s a wondrously otherworldly experience to walk in these clouds. You feel like you&rsquo;re venturing
through some alternate dimension suspended between heaven and Earth. Look up and all you see is
clouds; look down and even the ground seems to fade from view as the mist swarms around your legs.
Suddenly, a slit opens in the clouds above unleashing a flood of sunlight, and all the mist around
you evaporates just as quickly as it appeared.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adagio</em></strong></p>

<p>After an entire week of crowds, fumes, and fluorescent lights, I retreat to the beaches of Shek O,
the woods of Sai Kung Country Park, or the peaks of Ma On Shan. Here, there&rsquo;s no trace of the
daily grind, urban throngs, or artificial amenities. The mountains are a sanctuary where I get my
weekly fix of solitude, wholesome air, and Mother Nature.</p>

<p><em>I ran out of stuff to say. Shocking, I know. So here&rsquo;s a bunch of photos for your mindless
viewing pleasure.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Life consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence
refreshes him. One who pressed forward incessantly and never rested from his labors, who grew fast
and infinite demands on life, would always find himself in a new country or wilderness, and
surrounded by the raw material of life. He would be climbing over the prostrate stems of primitive
forest-trees.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For I believe that climate does thus react on man, – as there is something in the mountain-air
that feeds the spirit and inspires. Will not man grow to greater perfection intellectually as well
as physically under these influences?&#8230;I trust that we shall be more imaginative, that our thoughts
will be clearer, fresher, and more ethereal, as our sky, – our understanding more comprehensive
and broader, like our plains, – our intellect generally on a grander scale, like our thunder and
lightning, our rivers and mountains and forests, – and our hearts shall even correspond in breadth
and depth and grandeur to our inland seas.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the natural remedy is to be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day, the
winter to the summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the more air and sunshine in
our thoughts. The callous palms of the laborer are conversant with finer tissues of self-respect
and heroism, whose touch thrills the heart, than the languid fingers of idleness. That is mere
sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from the tan and callus of
experience.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walking</cite></footer></blockquote>

Is it true? Does it improve upon the silence?","source":"Shirdi Sai Baba"},{"quote":"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
