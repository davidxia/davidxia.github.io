  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although it&rsquo;s interesting to watch a single, white mother struggle to raise her two sons with
income derived solely from dealing marijuana to an entire suburban California community, I think
I&rsquo;ll stop. I finished the entire first season of Showtime&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/weeds/home.do"><em>Weeds</em></a> in one day (my gratitude to
Megavideo for illegally hosting them all conveniently <a href="http://watch-weeds.com/">here</a>). Although the show has smart
dialogue and engaging characters, there are aspects of it that don&rsquo;t sit well.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What&rsquo;s most troubling is the lightness with which serious issues are treated. Nancy Botwin, the
main character of <em>Weeds</em> is a recent widow who resorts to selling pot to the white-picket-fence,
dysfunctional town of Agrestic in order to maintain her lifestyle. Her clients include a city
councilman, lawyers, local adolescents, and students at a local community college. The show brings
up, or rather constantly exhibits, topics such as drugs, sex, and family strife. Instead of
treating them with the seriousness they demand, <em>Weeds</em> trivializes their severity and brushes
them off as hilarious plot developments. The outcomes of Agrestic&rsquo;s upper-middle class residents&#8217;
half-baked (pun totally intended) and oftentimes morally questionable behavior transpire without
consequences. Within the first few episodes, adultery is committed, spouses are caught in mid
coital bliss induced by tennis rackets, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWtGEYUaE2I&amp;feature=related" title="wonder how long before Youtube yanks for copyright infringement">heads are shaven in vengeance</a> – all without any
lasting repercussions.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TDNymyj_3DI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WzrCatQ9dHE/s800/weeds1.jpg" width="240" height="240" title="I thought they were selling weed not daisies" ></p>

<p>Celia Hodes is a blonde-haired, ruthless, gangsta Barbie who rules her household with a fist of
steel. Upon discovering that her slight-chubby daughter Isabelle is disobeying her dietary
restrictions by hiding a stash of chocolates, Celia surreptitiously replaces them with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U1LVdVpyKo">laxatives</a>. I agree with Mr. Hodes, even though he&rsquo;s hardly one to act as the moral authority,
when he asks his wife, &ldquo;Are you out of your fucking mind?&rdquo; Isabelle finds out her mother&rsquo;s tactic
and one ups her by slipping Imodium into Celia&rsquo;s food causing her to suffer massive constipation.
The disturbing nature of the mother-daughter relationship is highlighted when Isabelle, who cannot
be older than eight years, telling Celia she wishes her mother were still dying from cancer because
then she&rsquo;d be a better person.</p>

<p>The dangers of mindless sex and ethical questions of drug abuse by pillars of society are shrugged
aside as an afterthought in <em>Weeds</em>. Nancy&rsquo;s oldest son Silas has sex at 15, takes ecstasy at 16,
and she can do little to stop him. Her brother-in-law, a womanizer with a shady history,
impersonates his nephew and lures a 16-year-old handicapped girl into having cybersex. The
genuinely touching scenes of the once whole Botwin family before their father Judah&rsquo;s death are
eclipsed by the show&rsquo;s lack of respect and grievance towards the dead at Judah&rsquo;s Jewish tombstone
unveiling ceremony.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TDNynBL0cGI/AAAAAAAAAYI/csFCWZk0EgI/s800/weeds.jpg" width="300" height="375" title="you see?" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate <em>Weeds</em> is wantonly sensational. Nancy has sex in broad public daylight with a
Mexican drug dealer who&rsquo;s been threatening her family for several days, and worst of all, it
somehow neutralizes the problem. (He buys her a cute satin teddy soon after their car trunk tryst.)
I suspect the producers are the ones behind the show&rsquo;s exploitation of the physical
attractiveness of Mary-Louise Parker who plays Nancy. It&rsquo;s not hard to see why many of the male
characters find Nancy alluring, but <em>Weeds</em> focuses on Parker&rsquo;s beauty to the extent you start to
think the lives of their ratings depended on it. I also suspect Parker&rsquo;s not happy about this.
Weeds*&lsquo; fourth season ends with Parker in a revealing bathtub scene. In an interview for MORE
magazine, Parker said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I needed to be naked, and I fought with the director about
it, and now I&rsquo;m bitter&hellip;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t done that. I was goaded into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are reasons why <em>Weeds</em> has so many viewers and such successful ratings.
It&rsquo;s entertaining, hilarious, and witty. But some things should not be portrayed so lightly. There
is a difference between raising awareness about difficult, taboo topics and forcing the audience
to confront them with due gravity and simply sensationalizing and then trivializing the
consequences. <em>Weeds</em> is guilty of the latter. This offense would be fine if the series were
simply a feel-good sitcom, but the show is an odd hybrid of drama and comedy. When Nancy&rsquo;s eyes
water from watching videos of her husband building a beryllium atom model with their younger son
Shane, I sympathize with her, but when she toasts with her partners in crime to the expansion of
her marijuana racket in Shane&rsquo;s plain sight (in a Francis-Coppola-Godfather-like manner), it
leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I feel deceived into liking a morally reprehensible character.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s also a larger question here: what do we do about shows that we feel go against our
values and principles? Tom Ashbrook, the host of National Public Radio&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/"><em>On Point</em></a> program,
recently <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/2009/05/lauren-zalaznick">interviewed Lauren Zalaznick</a>, president of NBC Universal Women and Lifestyle
Entertainment Networks. Under Zalaznick, NBC has come up with shows like
<a href="http://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey"><em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em></a> and <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/top-chef"><em>Top Chef</em></a>. I was surprised at the number of
callers criticizing Zalaznick&rsquo;s programming. Here are a few of the most vehement ones:</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t waste your time watching the mindless, brain-rotting, sleazy, programming that Lauren
Zalaznick offers up on her mickey mousey networks.</p><footer><strong>Joe B.</strong> <cite><a href='http://onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/lauren-zalaznick#comment-144183631'>onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Well, I think it&#8217;s clear from the interview thus far that she is just a purveyor of dreck who
knows nothing more than what sells. Calling this stuff &#8220;pop culture&#8221; doesn&#8217;t redeem it. It&#8217;s still
dreck. Worse, it&#8217;s another brain-numbing opiate for a society that needs less diversion, not more.</p><footer><strong>Joe B.</strong> <cite><a href='http://onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/lauren-zalaznick#comment-144183662'>onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>This one was picked simply because of the potential for a great show:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a glib apologist for her foul TV shows, your guest is amazing. I think that the shows she
produces are a sort of pornography, where you leer at the low IQs and damaged self esteem of
people who should feel ashamed to put themselves on display. What do you do after &#8220;Dance Your Ass
Off?&#8221; &#8220;Celebrity Bowel Movements?&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Joe B.</strong> <cite><a href='http://onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/lauren-zalaznick#comment-144183714'>onpoint.wbur.org/2009/05/28/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TDNynpwHIFI/AAAAAAAAAYM/5wlZUfTyLQk/s800/new-jersey.jpg" title="&#34;couldn't resist&#34;" alt="&#34;couldn't resist&#34;"></p>

<p>On second thought, it&rsquo;s not surprising an overwhelming majority of NPR callers objected to
Zalaznick&rsquo;s shows. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine someone who watches <em>The Real Housewives</em> with gusto and
then tunes in to <em>On Point</em>.</p>

<p>Zalaznick argued her shows were honestly describing lifestyles of real Americans. She pointed to
the shows&#8217; successes as their justification. Many of the critics fired back with the accusation
that the shows, by displaying such lifestyles, were prescriptive. These callers implied the media
had a role in society as an arbiter of morality. Zalaznick disagreed. It seems she thinks of the
media as a mirror reflecting the desires of society. If the public wants it, they&rsquo;ll put it on.</p>

<p>Media has tremendous influence. So responsibilities does it have? To what extent should it be
bound by moral standards? Can we separate the descriptive from the prescriptive?</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea how to answer these questions, but they are manifested in debates
ranging video game violence to the age-old critique that such dreck is responsible for social decay.
For me, I&rsquo;ll stop watching <em>Weeds</em>, partially because there are simply better shows out there
and one has to be selective. I&rsquo;m going to watch <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire/"><em>The Wire</em></a> now.</p>
