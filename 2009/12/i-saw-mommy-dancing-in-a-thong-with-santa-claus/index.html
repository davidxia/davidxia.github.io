<p>My friend told me he was recently involved in an &ldquo;epic incident.&rdquo; Since we go to different colleges,
I asked him what happened. He sent me the following excerpt from his resident advisor&rsquo;s logbook.
I assume he received it in the mail with the rest of the notice that said his school was
suspending him for a semester.</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p><strong>Incident Narrative: April 11, 2009</strong></p>

<p>RA Christensen was walking by Blanca and could hear a party coming from apartment 206 from
  outside. I went up to knock on the door, and Adam [friend in question] answered the door in a
  thong that said &ldquo;Your place or mine&rdquo;. He would not let me in the room because he said the girls
  are stripping. I was concerned and asked him if I could just take a peak. When I glanced in I saw
  around 10 people half naked or naked both guys and girls dancing. I became very uncomfortable and
  did not know how to respond to the situation. I told Adam that he could not be having this party,
  and I thought that the risk for an unwanted sexual advance was very high. He was not compliant and
  told me that he wanted to be written up. Feeling uncomfortable, I left and called campus safety to
  deal with the situation. I realize that it might be technically allowed, but it was raising MANY
  red flags in my mind. I can see people regretting that night later. When I walked outside, I could
  see people dancing and grinding naked on the tables. The blinds were not open but I was able to
  see through the blinds and one open window. Campus safety came, but I do not know the result of
  the situation. Also the night before, I saw Austin Martinson in the apartment dancing on a table
  in a thong with the blinds open, so I called the RA on duty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I stopped laughing, I realized this report creates more questions than answers. Some of these
questions led me to believe RA Christensen is incompetent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did Adam answer the door in a thong? Have the decency to put on a bra or a bathrobe. Perhaps
he was expecting an invited guest, but it&rsquo;s still a big risk.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s funny that the incident report is called an &ldquo;incident narrative,&rdquo; as if it has to be a well
told story.</li>
<li>The RA wanted to &ldquo;just take a peak.&rdquo; This language made him/her sound like a peeping Tom implicit
in the debauchery. I would&rsquo;ve used &ldquo;examine the situation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s interesting that the RA noted
his/her own psychological state: &ldquo;did not know how to respond to the situation.&rdquo; I doubt many
people, other than those who&rsquo;ve been living nudist colonies, would.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The risk for an unwanted sexual advance was very high.&rdquo; At first, this seems possible, but on
second thought, how could there possibly be &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; sexual advances. Adam most likely planned
the party as one giant sexual advance. We know that the ten participants at this point were either
naked or half-naked. Anyone who&rsquo;s feeling uncomfortable would&rsquo;ve left or at least stopped dancing.
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine someone who couldn&rsquo;t foresee a sexual advance at that point.</li>
<li>Why did Adam want to be written up? How could he be both &ldquo;not compliant&rdquo; and willing to be written
up? Why was he/she such a buzzkill by calling campus safety without first trying to stop the party
him/herself or at least giving some advance warning?</li>
<li>&ldquo;I was able to see through the blinds&rdquo; Did the RA have x-ray vision?</li>
<li>The last sentence is completely unrelated to the incident at hand. Was Austin&rsquo;s apartment the same
as Adam&rsquo;s? Austin could&rsquo;ve been dancing in a thong by himself for all we know.</li>
</ul>
