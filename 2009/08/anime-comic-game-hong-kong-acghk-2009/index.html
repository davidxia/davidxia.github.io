  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m racking my brains over what to say about the <a href="http://www.ani-com.hk/front.htm">Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong 2009</a>
convention because I have never before found myself immersed in something so utterly foreign and
bizarre. The manga fans I know in the States are mere wannabes compared to the 600,000 plus
enthusiasts who flocked to this year&rsquo;s ACGHK sporting imitation M41 carbines, full sets of samurai
armor with matching katanas, and hair of every conceivable unnatural color under the sun.</p>

<div class='image left'><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2AlBWAaeSqE/TyB8SZ6RsuI/AAAAAAAAAEs/c9O0Ux77X0E/s800/1.jpg" width="252" height="378" title="Those are big magazines, if you know what I mean" alt="ACGHK cosplay girl with big gun"><div class='caption'>Those are big magazines, if you know what I mean</div></div>


<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay">Cosplay</a>,&rdquo; short for costume roleplay, is the term for decking yourself out in otherworldly
attire and behave like your favorite animated character. It&rsquo;s not at all dissimilar from the Star
Wars aficionados who dress up as Jedis and storm troopers and Sith lords while waiting hours in
line at the box office. Or the legions of students who, under the spell of Ms. Rowling and the
silver screen, transform themselves from muggles into wizards by donning robes and picking up
Nimbus 2000s.</p>

<div class='image right'><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-05QVmBGCJbM/TyB8SU9tiEI/AAAAAAAAAEs/jCcBgkUjVOo/s800/2.jpg" width="333" height="500" title="I have no words" alt="every conceivable unnatural hair color under the sun"><div class='caption'>I have no words</div></div>


<p>The ACGHK was held at Hong Kong&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Convention_and_Exhibition_Centre">Convention and Exhibition Center</a>, five stories of concrete
and glass providing 92,000m2 of rentable space, all built in only four years, artificial island
included. Accompanied by two fellow HK interns and a Mormon guy from Utah (another story for
another time), I made my way through cosplayers, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tramboy">tramboys</a>, and prurient photographers.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-V_QTC06FHxU/TyB8SXH3GzI/AAAAAAAAAEs/Kd3Dk4Dtqvo/s800/3.jpg" title="head-to-head fighting game at ACGHK 2009" ></p>

<p>We saw posters of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon">Doraemon</a>, a wormhole-traveling cat, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda-Z">Panda-Z</a>, a battery-chomping,
robotic panda. Teenage males with permed, red hair took turns going head-to-head in a Street
Fighter-style computer game while friends cheered them on. Across the aisle, Microsoft hired two
women to promote its X-box 360 console– the breasts of one seemed to claw their way out from her
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheongsam">cheongsam</a> like Master Chief busting out of a Pelican dropship.</p>

<div class='image right'><img  src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--c2QoRbV628/TyB8SXeUrNI/AAAAAAAAAEs/ITiuX4_zchg/s800/4.jpg" width="240" height="180" title="Uh, Miss, I think you missed a couple of buttons." ><div class='caption'>Uh, Miss, I think you missed a couple of buttons.</div></div>


<p>Further into the heart of the convention, stalls sold wooden katanas and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html?em">Grass Mud Horses</a>.
Girls wearing military uniforms of a fashion-conscious Third Reich congregated in corners while
adolescent males stood in circuitous lines for a chance to shake hands with members of a Japanese
girl band called <a href="http://www.scandal-4.com/">Scandal</a>. At least these guys were still making an effort to touch real women.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VyMRtdF6xXc/TyB8SbLamwI/AAAAAAAAAEs/TWdhXwp3WOY/s800/5.jpg" title="The f**k your mom horse" ></p>

<p>At a booth selling T-shirts, a college-aged person explained to me the prevalent Japanese and
Taiwanese influences behind anime and manga. He held up a T-shirt printed with the word &ldquo;Tramboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a guy who spends all his time in his room playing video games and watching anime,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t talk to girls at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The T-shirt seller talked about the near religious fanaticism that anime and manga can induce. It
got me thinking. The line between a strong interest/passion and an unhealthy obsession is rather
fine. Certainly, a strong dependency on an activity and an interest&rsquo;s interference on an individua
&rsquo;s ability to function normally are both necessary criteria. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> are not the only ones who
ve crossed it. Academics to politicians, tech fanboys to football hooligans, philatelists to storm
chasers, all have respective members who&rsquo;ve gone off the deep end.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uIF7L6R332o/TyB8Sclo99I/AAAAAAAAAAA/sutq2bOgasg/s800/6.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="tramboys?" ><div class='caption'>tramboys?</div></div>


<p>I asked the fellow his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reno?&rdquo; I asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reno. As in Reno, Nevada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we walked further into the heart of the convention, robotic cats and pandas gradually
disappeared, anime characters traded cuddliness for curves, and admiration morphed into voyeurism.
Past the convention&rsquo;s heart and deep into its bowels, I paused next to a booth selling four-foot
long pillows whose covers showcased young women in bikinis embracing palm trees with their thighs
so firmly you&rsquo;d think typhoon <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8189466.stm">Morakot</a> was about to make landfall any minute. A middle-aged
gentleman stopped at the booth. He was piqued. He began looking through the pillowcases, and I
felt the excitement at witnessing a member of a fascinating subculture in action only days after
reading a <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26FOB-2DLove-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=asia">article</a> on these so-called 2-D lovers.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TI5z9h8X7KI/AAAAAAAAAmE/z61CpcAINNQ/s800/last.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="2-D love" ><div class='caption'>2-D love</div></div>


<p>As we exited the convention center, we passed by yet another crowd of photographers swarming
around yet another scantily clad female who elicited flash photography as if the Messiah himself
had just materialized in the flesh. As I walked by, I wondered, &ldquo;Where would a femme fatale like
that holster her Glock? In her garter?&rdquo;</p>
