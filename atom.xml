    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I blogged about something tech related, but I had some
free time today.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to refactor an internal Spotify deployment tool my
team built and maintains. This deployment tool takes Kubernetes (k8s) YAML
manifests, changes them, and essentially runs <code>kubectl apply</code>. We add metadata
to the k8s manifests like labels.</p>

<p>Right now this tool receives the input YAML as strings, converts them to
Jackson ObjectNodes, and manipulates those ObjectNodes. The disadvantage of
this is that there&rsquo;s no k8s type-safety. We might accidentally add a field to a
Deployment that isn&rsquo;t valid or remove something from a Service that&rsquo;s required.</p>

<p>My refactor uses upstream k8s model classes from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java">kubernetes-client/java</a>
which are themselves <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen">generated</a> from the official Swagger spec. Here&rsquo;s a
helpful Yaml utility class that deserializes YAML strings into concrete classes
and can also serialize them back into YAML strings. So helpful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s some bugs in the YAML (de)serialization that prevent me
from finishing this effort.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/pull/417">kubernetes-client/java issue 417</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/431">kubernetes-client/java issue 431</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/340">kubernetes-client/java issue 340</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;ll be much nicer to change k8s resources in a type-safe way
instead of parsing and rewriting raw YAML strings.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m compiling a list of Internet meme role models. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far. These people &mdash;
they must be real human beings &mdash; must have either gone out of their way to do the right

ridiculous. And they must be memeified. Exceptions will be made for exceptional but not
memeified people like Hilde Lysiak.</p>

<p>Who else deserves to be on this list?</p>

if my maternal grandparents are there, they make hundreds of dumplings for me.
I try to help out. We make everything from scratch including the skins. I&rsquo;m good at rolling the
skins but have much to learn on all other parts of the process. I&rsquo;m becoming better at packing
and closing the dumplings now though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to cherish this little tradition more and more. I need to plan my next trip to Boston!</p>

    <updated>2017-06-01T06:36:06-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2017/06/four-fascinating-and-weird-people</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are the stories of four fascinating and weird people that will make you laugh, be inspired,
or cringe. Chang and Eng Bunker were conjoined twins who married two sisters and were slave-owners
on the side of the Southern Confederacy. Rose Wilder Lane is the daughter of the author who wrote
the <em>Little House</em> childrens books, a founding member of the American Libertarian movement, and just
all around boss ass bitch. John Harvey Kellogg was the inventor of corn flakes, doctor, zealous
anti-masturbation campaigner, and eugenicist.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Chang and Eng Bunker</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_and_Eng_Bunker">Chang and Eng</a> were two conjoined twins born
in Vietnam in the 1800s. The term &ldquo;Siamese twins&rdquo; is based on them.</p>

<blockquote><p>The brothers were joined at the sternum by a small piece of cartilage, and though their livers
  were fused, they were independently complete.</p></blockquote>

<p>After a Scotsman noticed them and paraded them around as a freak show attraction for ten
years, the Bunker twins settled down in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. They married two local white
women who were sisters. They became naturalized American citizens and even owned slaves.</p>

<p>The Bunkers and their wives slept in a bed built for four. After a while their wives started to not
get along. So they alternated between two different houses. Chang had twelve children while
Eng had ten. Today their descendents number more than 1,500 and hold reunions. Their liver is on
display in at the MÃ¼tter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2>2. Rose Wilder Lane</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane">Rose Wilder Lane</a> was the eldest child of Laura
Ingalls Wilder, the ostensible author of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Little_House_on_the_Prairie_books">Little House book series</a>.
Lane was by all means a boss ass bitch who lived a full life.</p>

<p>Sick of crop failures and tough frontier life, Lane moved in 1908 to San Francisco, California.
She married a salesman named Gillette Lane and became pregnant. Sadly, her son was stillborn, and
a subsequent surgery left her unable to have kids.</p>

<blockquote><p>She felt her intellectual interests did not mesh with the life she was living with her husband.
Keenly aware of her lack of a formal education, during these years, Lane read voraciously and
taught herself several languages. Her writing career began around 1908, with occasional
freelance newspaper jobs that earned much-needed extra cash.</p><footer><strong>Early career, marriage and divorce</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane#Early_career.2C_marriage_and_divorce'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Lane&rsquo;s writing career took off. She wrote for publications like <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> and <em>Saturday Evening
Post</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the late 1920s, Lane was reputed to be one of the highest-paid female writers in America, and
along with Hoover, she counted among her friends well known figures such as Sinclair Lewis,
Isabel Paterson, Dorothy Thompson, John Patric, and Lowell Thomas.</p><footer><strong>Freelance writing career</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane#Freelance_writing_career'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>When Lane&rsquo;s mother approached her with a rough autobiographical manuscript of her own childhood,
Lane sensed that an American public fatigued by the Great Depression would take to the story of
the loving, persistent, and independent Ingalls family. Lane encouraged and helped her mother
rewrite and sell the story as a children&rsquo;s novel. The book became a big success, and an entire
series replete with T.V. shows, merchandise, and museums followed. Their family was raking
in the dough.</p>

<p>I read the entire series as a kid and stil wax nostalgic for it. I thought Lane&rsquo;s mother, who&rsquo;s the
titled author, wrote every book on her own and only received encouragement from her Lane. It turns
out, however, that the truth is more interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;an ongoing mutual collaboration that involved Lane more extensively in the
earlier books, and to a much lesser extent by the time the series ended, as Wilder&#8217;s confidence
in her own writing ability increased. Lane insisted to the end that her role was little more than
that of her mother&#8217;s adviser, despite documentation to the contrary&#8230;Literary historians
believe that Lane&#8217;s editing skills brought the dramatic pacing, literary structure, and
characterization critically needed to make the stories publishable in book form.</p><footer><strong>Literary collaboration</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane#Literary_collaboration'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Even more fascinating is Lane&rsquo;s societal and political views. She was a libertarian, economically
laissez faire, anti-racist, and anti-communist. She protested paying income taxes, opposed the New
Deal, and thought Social Security was a Ponzi scheme that would destroy the United States.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lane played a hands-on role during the 1940s and 1950s in launching the &#8220;libertarian movement&#8221;
and began an extensive correspondence with figures such as DuPont executive Jasper Crane and
writer Frank Meyer, as well as her friend and colleague, Ayn Rand. She wrote book reviews
for the National Economic Council and later for the Volker Fund, out of which grew the Institute
for Humane Studies. Later, she lectured at, and gave generous financial support to, the Freedom
School headed by libertarian Robert LeFevre.</p><footer><strong>Later years and death</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane#Later_years_and_death'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I want to reread the <em>Little House</em> books now knowing she was a die-hard libertarian who along with
her mother purposefully wove themes of individualism into the series.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rose Wilder Lane died in her sleep at age 81, on October 30, 1968, just as she was about to
depart on a three-year world tour. She was buried next to her parents at Mansfield Cemetery in
Mansfield, Missouri.</p><footer><strong>Later years and death</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Wilder_Lane#Later_years_and_death'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>3. John Harvey Kellogg</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the entire Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a> yet since
a colleague only recently drew my attention to this smart, prolific, and bizarre man. These parts
stood out to me at first glance though.</p>

<ul>
<li>he invented corn flakes with his brother, Will Keith Kellogg</li>
<li>he was a medical doctor &ldquo;who ran a sanitarium using holistic methods, with a particular focus on
nutrition, enemas, and exercise. Kellogg was an advocate of vegetarianism&rdquo;</li>
<li>he also created various phototherapeutic and electrotherapeutic inventions</li>
<li>he advocated sexual abstinence and &ldquo;advocated keeping the diet plain to prevent sexual arousal&rdquo;</li>
<li>he was an &ldquo;especially zealous campaigner against masturbation&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>He also recommended, to prevent children from this &#8220;solitary vice&#8221;, bandaging or tying their hands,
covering their genitals with patented cages and electrical shock.</p><footer><strong>Masturbation prevention</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<ul>
<li>he liked yogurt enemas</li>
<li>he was a eugenicist</li>
</ul>

two large plastic bottles, a pre-paid mailing label, and detailed instructions. The instructions
said to fill one bottle with water after not using any faucet in my apartment for six hours. I
filled the second bottle with water after having run the tap. After dropping the bottles now full

    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2016/07/spotify-organized-surfing-trip-in-costa-rica-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In March 2015, about twenty colleagues and I went on a Spotify-organized surf trip to Santa Teresa,
Costa Rica for a week of surf lessons. The company, surf, and food were unforgettable. One of Spotify&rsquo;s
social events organizers knew <a href="www.surfakademin.se">a group of traveling Swedish surf instructors</a>,
and helped get a group discount for Spotifiers and their guests. The total cost of lodging, lessons,
and daily breakfast and lunch was about $650 for a week.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="https://i.imgur.com/WvJyqW4l.jpg" width="640" height="480" title="The relaxing mini-resort where we stayed. It had a pool, lounge areas, and a small cafe." ><div class='caption'>The relaxing mini-resort where we stayed. It had a pool, lounge areas, and a small cafe.</div></div>


<p>The best memories I have from the trip are waking up at the crack of dawn every day, grabbing a
surf board, and rushing headlong into the water. The sun was gentle in the early morning, but the
waves were not. The force and speed of the ocean awed and at times terrified me. I&rsquo;d paddle like mad
to get over waves, but every once in a while, a monster swell would catch me at the worst moment.
The crest of the wave would hit me like a hammer and sweep me aside like a match stick. I was taught
to cover my head with my arms to prevent the surf board from giving me a concussion.
Eventually I learned to do a turtle roll and was able to see a bit ahead of time if a wave would be
large or small.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours of surfing on an empty stomach, I would be ravenous. Our group would trudge
back to the resort where several Costa Rican women staff members had prepared a large
breakfast for us: scrambled eggs, watermelon and pineapple,
salad, rice and beans, and plantains. I&rsquo;d go back for seconds and thirds.</p>

<p>One of my colleagues Fredrik and I were pretty good beginners and had the privilege of being invited
by the instructors to a different beach at least an hour&rsquo;s drive away from the
resort. Fredrik and I rode in a taxi with one of the instructors and two other guests who were
seasoned surfers. The ride through dirt and gravel roads was bumpy and hot and all around unpleasant.
A sandless beach awaited us when we arrived. I lathered on sunscreen to protect against the intense
midday sun, took my board, and carefully walked across the seemingly endless stretch of sharp rocks
until I could mount my board and start paddling. After an hour of surfing, I remember being
exhausted but extremely grateful that I was lucky enough to experience the raw power of mother
nature in such a majestic setting. I was also extremely grateful I hadn&rsquo;t been injured so far on the
trip. The waves could be truly terrifying.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-08T22:51:51-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2016/07/my-first-open-water-swimming-event</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I visited the southern UK with my parents last March. We visited the coast where I took a photo of the
English Channel and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidxia2/posts/10102320113525692">posted it on Facebook</a> with the caption,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking across the English Channel now wondering if I have what it takes to swim across to
France. It&rsquo;s 21 miles across at its narrowest point and the fastest swimmer made it across in a
little over seven hours and the slowest one was 27 hours. Average water temperatures in the summer
are 14-18 degrees Celsius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My high school swim coach Jen saw it and said, &ldquo;If you are seriously considering, let me know &mdash; I
have many friends who have done this swim (yes I hang out with weirdos)!&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s start with
something a bit more realistic I said. Jen encouraged me to participate in the annual Wayland Three
Mile Swim which she organizes. The race takes place in Lake Cochituate, a small body of water in
Wayland, Massachusetts which borders my hometown of Wellesley.</p>

<p>So I <a href="https://www.davidxia.com/2016/04/when-routine-becomes-ritual/">trained religiously</a> for three months. A couple of days before June 19,
I took a bus from New York City back to Wellesley for the open water swim that would start at
7:30AM.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My parents were very supportive of my endeavor and even woke up with me at 5AM to come watch.
We drove fifteen minutes to Wayland Town Beach. I met and hugged Jen and my other high school coach
Sandy both of whom I haven&rsquo;t seen in many years. We waited for a boat to setup the large
neon-colored, inflatable buoys in the lake.</p>

<p>There were twenty swimmers registered for the three mile race. I didn&rsquo;t have any expectations for
myself. I never swam continuously for such a long distance before (I was a sprinter in high school),
so my base goal was to simply finish within two hours, the maximum time allowed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<ol>
<li>I did better than I thought I would. <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/results/16/ma/Jun19_Waylan_set6.shtml">1 hour and 30 minutes.</a></li>
<li>I had my ass handed to me by 50-year-old men and teenage girls.
(Jeff Naylor, age 57, came in second place with a time of 1:05:21. Jeff, what are you on?
&#35;lifegoals)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d definitely do it again. The water and weather were perfect. The lake tasted great.
I know because I drank half of it.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here are some photos.</p>

    <id>https://www.davidxia.com/2016/06/my-strange-swimming-experiences</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had some strange swimming experiences.</p>

<p>In 2012 I vacationed on a tiny cay in Belize with a group of college friends.
The island was so small that its surface area was probably equal to that of a  medium-sized suburban
house. An even smaller cay lay a quarter of a mile away with nothing but white sand, coral
reefs, and pristine blue water separating them. One day I decided to swim to the smaller island
and back. I wore a long-sleeved shirt and pants to not get sunburned and waded into the water with
my snorkel mask. I carefully made my way around the sharp corals near the island. Once the water
became deep enough, I was surrounded by nothing but deep blue water.
I couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom or any distinguishable shapes in the ocean.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="https://i.imgur.com/LDg8qfd.jpg" width="640" height="322" title="Photo by Todd Quackenbush is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0" ><div class='caption'>Photo by Todd Quackenbush is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</div></div>


<p>I started seeing ghostly shapes swimming around me. I was scared because I
wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was seeing large fish or if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.
I had seen barricudas, rays, and sharks in the water on previous days. I kept swimming. By now I
was halfway to the other island. After about 20 minutes I reached shore.
The ocean&rsquo;s depths and creatures made me feel naked and vulnerable and at times like I
was going crazy. But I stuck it out and felt strangely triumphant afterwards.</p>

<iframe class="fill-width" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-Ii7pKSEkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I was six and attending summer camp. The counselors occasionally took us to the Evelyn Kirrane Aquatics
Center in Brookline, Massachusetts. One day I stepped into the deep-end of a pool without knowing
and began to panic. I tried screaming but couldn&rsquo;t get my mouth out of the water long enough to
take a breath and exhale. I started gulping a lot of water. Luckily, it was a small pool, and I
eventually made my way to the wall. I was surprised, however, that I couldn&rsquo;t signal for help and
that no one seemed to notice my distress. Later in life I learned it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ribride.co.uk/blog/drowning-does-not-look-like-drowning/" title="A Drowning Person Does Not Look Like a Drowning Person">difficult for an untrained
person to notice that someone is drowning</a>. Many small children drown each year just a short
distance away from their parents.</p>

<p>I lap swim regularly at the Chelsea Recreation Center. Multiple swimmers share a single lane by
swimming counter-clockwise. One day, another swimmer was swimming towards me in the opposite direction.
According to the rules, we each stuck to our respective right-hand sides. He must&rsquo;ve been a large
person because his wake was bigger than I&rsquo;m used to. I tilted my head to the side and took a breath
just as his wake hit me. Water unexpectedly entered my mouth and nose. I was surprised by how my
brain went into auto-pilot emergency mode. I tensed up and began to flail involuntarily.
The water and lack of breath was a strong signal to my brain that overrode everything else.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a story of I jumped through countless complex bureaucratic, legal, and financial hurdles of
Murphy&rsquo;s Law and emerged with less liquidity and more debt. OK. I&rsquo;m being facetious, but what
happened to me is the easiest and most straightforward way to buy a property. Seriously.
The events below transpired in New York City. The buying process may be different in other areas,
but the most of the process such as contract of sale and mortgage application is the same across
the U.S.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>My mother found an affordable co-op unit for sale while browsing StreetEasy on her iPad
during Christmas vacation in 2015.</li>
<li>We noticed the listing was made by the seller himself. I emailed him that night.</li>
<li>The seller promptly called me. I scheduled a viewing of the unit which is at the top
of a six-floor walk-up.</li>
<li>My parents and I climbed the six flights of stairs and met the seller who was a nice man named
Alan. We walked around and inspected his unit.</li>
<li>We asked Alan about the apartment&rsquo;s condition, the co-op&rsquo;s financials and rules, the property
manager, etc.</li>
<li>We sat down with Alan, chatted, and negotiated. My mother pointed out neither party has a broker
which is good because brokers take a 6% commission. We felt out Alan on how many offers he&rsquo;s
received and what they are.</li>
<li>My mother verbally offered Alan 94% of the listing price. He said he&rsquo;ll see. My mom seemed
confident he&rsquo;d take it. I was impressed by her ability to knock off over $20K right off the bat.</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>My parents and I started looking for a mortgage broker and an attorney who&rsquo;s good with co-op
purchases. (They were professional and competent. Contact me if you want a referral.)</li>
<li>We decided how much money we wanted to borrow and how long. I settled on a 15-year mortgage at a
great interest rate of 2.875%. I minimized closing and discount points in order to pay less money
up front.</li>
<li>My mortgage broker Deborah started collecting relevant documents from me to start the mortgage
approval process. These include but aren&rsquo;t limited to bank statements, pay stubs (W2), federal
income tax returns (1040). I didn&rsquo;t have to use a mortgage broker and could&rsquo;ve shopped around
myself simply by applying online at various commercial banks&#8217; websites. But I&rsquo;m pretty busy,
and the broker&rsquo;s fee would be paid by the lender in my case.</li>
<li>Alan accepted our verbal offer and sent over a contract of sale. This document is a major
checkpoint. It stated what, when, and how we would exchange property and money. Once I signed it
and included a contract deposit (10% of the purchase price), it meant Alan and I were in a
legally binding agreement and that he wasn&rsquo;t considering any other offers.

<ul>
<li>If I reneged, Alan could keep my contract deposit.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what legal recourse or damages I could pursue if Alan reneged. The contract
vaguely stated:

<blockquote><p>In the event of a default or misrepresentation by Seller, Purchaser shall have such remedies
as Purchaser is entitled to at law or in equity, including specific performance, because
the Unit and possession thereof cannot be duplicated.</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our respective attorneys went back and forth modifying the contract of sale with riders that
protected each of us, respectively. For example, my attorney Andrew added a clause stipulating
the wall Alan built to divide the bedroom into two bedrooms was approved by the co-op board and
I would get a written approval letter at closing. Alan&rsquo;s attorney Michael added a clause stating
I couldn&rsquo;t back out of the sale if the maintenance increased after I&rsquo;d signed the contract.</li>
<li>I signed the contract on January 25, 2016. And I expected a counter-signed copy back shortly.</li>
<li>So I waited.</li>
<li>And waited.</li>
<li>And waited&hellip;</li>
<li>It seems that the more sellers there are on the contract, the more likely it there are to be
issues. In my case, there were a total of three sellers. Two of them were individuals:
Alan and his ex-wife. The third seller was the estate of Alan&rsquo;s deceased father. This estate
had two executors: Alan and his sister.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not confused yet, you will be.</li>
<li>Alan told me his ex-wife wasn&rsquo;t being cooperative with the sale but that a court order would
help convince her as a last resort.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, my mortgage broker Deborah was busy securing a lender for me. I also needed to have
the unit appraised which depended on the contract being fully signed.</li>
<li>On February 4, Deborah tells me the co-op has an insurance policy that&rsquo;s shared with other
buildings. She said most lenders won&rsquo;t underwrite a mortgage in a building with a pooled policy.
She said she&rsquo;ll try other lenders.</li>
<li>After an entire month (March 5 to be precise), Alan successfully compelled his ex-wife to sign
with the issuance of a court order. This allowed me to schedule the appraisal.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, I still hadn&rsquo;t secured the mortgage. Guaranteed Rate, Citi, Chase, Wells and various
portfolio lenders all refused. With each lender that turned me down because of
the co-op insurance policy, the more likely it seemed that Deborah and I would have to somehow
convince the co-op board to buy a new individual policy. The property management company would
also have to complete lots of paperwork. I&rsquo;ve never met the board, and the management company
seemed like a tangled bureaucracy. I was seriously questioning how I&rsquo;d be able to pull this off.</li>
<li><em>To be continued&hellip;</em></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been four years since I started working at Spotify. Every Friday, the
Technology, Product, and Design group at Spotify&rsquo;s New York City office
gathers to eat freshly catered snacks, introduce new hires, announce &ldquo;wins of the week,&rdquo; and
commemorate the anniversaries of existing employees.</p>

<p>Last Friday was my turn to stand before the couple hundred members of TPD. It&rsquo;s customary for people
celebrating their employment anniversaries to speak about their favorite Spotify memory.
I don&rsquo;t get many chances to address so many of my colleagues at
once. So I took this opportunity to prepare a short statement. It went something like this.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s my favorite Spotify memory? I have a hard time with this question because I don&rsquo;t have a
good answer. There&rsquo;s so many.</p>

<p>I find another question more interesting. That question is, &ldquo;What, after four years, makes me look
forward to getting up every weekday morning and working at Spotify?&rdquo; Four years is a long time to
be doing anything continuously.</p>

<p>I can tell you what&rsquo;s not the main reason. It&rsquo;s not the snacks or perks or the amazing office.
It&rsquo;s not even Celebration X [Spotify&rsquo;s massive 10-year anniversary party in Stockholm].
These are all great things, but they&rsquo;re not the main reason I show up everyday.</p>

<p>The main reason is values. I&rsquo;ve never been at a place where I share so many values with my
colleagues and the company. My teammates like Matt and Staffan and Mats share my values of hard
work, competence, and personal responsibility (and beer). The company constantly strives to become
a better version of itself through being risk-taking, passion, and compassion.</p>

<p>Every day is a new memory. Every day I feel blessed to be here working with all of you. Thank you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On April 16, seven friends and I went skydiving at Skydive the Ranch in New Jersey. We rented
a black SUV (a Hyundai that had terrible acceleration and braking) and each did a tandem dive.
It was a first for many of us including me.</p>

<p>My takeaway was that tandem diving out of a plane at 14-thousand feet is easy. The instructor takes
care of everything. I just had to sit back and enjoy the view. If anything went wrong and I died,
I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that bad about it because I wasn&rsquo;t the one who screwed it up.</p>

<p>Driving seven of your friends out of and back into New York City is nerve-wracking, on the other
hand. I was personally responsible for everyone&rsquo;s lives. Trying to return the rental car on time
while driving through Union Square in Manhattan where
there&rsquo;s a pedestrian fair going on, ambulances and cop cars, and drivers double parking wherever
they want is very stressful.</p>

<p>Hopefully Avis doesn&rsquo;t notice the small white scratch on the mirror of their mint condition car
(18 miles when I got it) that was left when I managed to squeeze through two city buses before they
crushed me.</p>
