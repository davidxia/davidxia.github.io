  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>A friend of mine who recently graduated from college told me (s)he &ldquo;used a dating site to ease a
transition and came to terms with newfound promiscuity.&rdquo; I shudder to think what the last part of
that description even means. I encouraged my friend to write a post for my blog and enlighten me
about his/her life after college. I was hoping for a witty David-Foster-Wallace-esque narrative. I
received something à la Daily Intel&rsquo;s <a href="http://nymag.com/tags/intel/sex">Sex Diaries</a>. Complete confidentiality was a
stipulation given the sensitive nature of the info below. Like Ira Glass says before he plays a
<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a> program that contains slightly mature content: for those with young
children, the below piece of writing &ldquo;acknowledges the existence of sexual acts.&rdquo;</em></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>12p.m.: I fly back into the country. On the subway to the office, a girl from my flight sits next
to me. I recognize her because of her enormous hiking backpack. She&rsquo;s lost, I try to offer
directions. We agree to go out to bars that night.</p>

<p>9p.m.: After work, I text girl from flight. She wakes up from a nap at the hostel. We agree to
meet downtown.</p>

<p>11:30p.m.: Meet her after getting lost, at which point she came out and walked five blocks to find
me. She looks good: heels, tight shirt, wavy blonde hair. She&rsquo;s with her college guy friend and
some people she met at the hostel at a bar. Find out she and her friend are not dating.</p>

<p>12a.m.: We go clubbing. I get the number of a friend of hers from the hostel, but she seems not to
be interested in talking to me.</p>

<p>1:30a.m.: I text a girl who I went on a date with before I left the country. Suggest that I should
meet her later. She agrees to find a place and pay for it.</p>

<p>2a.m.: Pry myself from hostel crew. The plane girl really doesn&rsquo;t want me to go, but they see me
booty call texting because the screen of my phone is enormous.</p>

<p>2:30a.m.: I meet the other girl, and we go to a cheap place she finds for the night. Sex with her
is rougher than I&rsquo;m used to. She&rsquo;s really curvy, which is also new for me. She gets upset because
I don&rsquo;t want to go down on her. I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>1p.m.: Wake up from some pretty horrible dreams. We both walk awkwardly to an intersection. She
asks if I&rsquo;ll call her back. I never call back girls who ask that.</p>

<p>1:30p.m.: Plane girl texts me to say that she&rsquo;s on a bus leaving the city. I tell her I&rsquo;m sorry to
see her go. She asks if I had a good time last night with curvy girl. I lie and say I went
straight home. I tell her I&rsquo;m sad to have missed hearing her sing karaoke last night. She calls me
a charming liar.</p>

<p>2:30p.m.: Guy staying at my place wrote a Post-It asking if I&rsquo;m okay. I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s staying over,
because I want to get my mind off the events of last night.</p>

<p>3:30p.m.: Curvy girl texts me to tell me that I have the best kiss. I delete her number.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>5p.m.: I have a date with a short girl from suburban PA whose entire family is made up of
churchgoers. We find a restaurant where the only thing we order is breaded chicken, dumplings and
beer. She somehow lets slip that her boyfriend of three years died a long time ago. I completely
tune out because she talks really aggressively.</p>

<p>6p.m.: She says she&rsquo;s very good at pool, so we go to the billiards. We don&rsquo;t talk mostly. I lose
every game. I say bye and go home.</p>

<p>7p.m.: Curvy girl texts me again and tells me that I&rsquo;m going to give boys of my ethnicity a bad
name if I give her the silent treatment. Afraid that she will stalk me down and stab me, I tell
her she&rsquo;s nice but I can&rsquo;t see anyone right now.</p>

<p>11p.m.: Friend asks me how date went. I grumble and shake my head. I tell him that I&rsquo;m about to
give up trying not to be an asshole.</p>

<h2>Day 4</h2>

<p>9a.m.: Work all day.</p>

<p>1p.m.: I check my dating site mail during work. Still have a habit of opening the site in an
incognito window. There&rsquo;s a few girls I promised to meet but didn&rsquo;t. Wonder if this is too much.</p>

<h2>Day 5</h2>

<p>9a.m.: Work all day.</p>

<p>12p.m.: Start emailing one girl who lives a few hours away. She can&rsquo;t come to the city, but I
think I would like her. She&rsquo;s taking a year off from school to work at a screen golf place.</p>

<p>2p.m.: We chat on the phone. I find out she&rsquo;s bi. I wonder what it is with me and bi girls.</p>

<h2>Day 6</h2>

<p>8:30am, After my friend leaves the apartment, I jack off. I think about the bi girl from the
suburbs. She&rsquo;s just my size and looks pretty cute in her work clothes, the pictures of which she
sent me yesterday.</p>

<p>9a.m.: Work all day.</p>

<p>11am, Increasingly convinced that my coworker has a crush on me. She flirts way more than is
necessary to maintain an amusing work atmosphere. I try to ignore it.</p>

<h2>Day 7</h2>

<p>9a.m.: Work all day.</p>

<p>10p.m.: Drinks with coworkers. I text my whereabouts to my friend so that he doesn&rsquo;t worry about
me. I&rsquo;m a little relieved that he has a committed boyfriend and a little foolish for assuming he
would have a crush on me otherwise.</p>

<p>Totals: One blowjob, one act of intercourse, one act of masturbation, one date, some random
flirtation.</p>
