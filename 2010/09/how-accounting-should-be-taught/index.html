  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a very good lecturer for my accounting class while at Columbia University. He was a Columbia
Business School associate professor who used to work for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen">Arthur Andersen</a>, one of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(audit_firms)#Big_8_.28until_1987.29">Big 8 auditing firms</a>. This professor was a big improvement over the previous undergraduate
accounting lecturer, a middle-aged woman with a dry teaching style who wore athletic sneakers
under an ankle-length dress.</p>

<p>My accounting professor made the subject interesting by stressing how not one single number on any
financial statement besides some cash flow figures can be verified. Pretty much everything from
balance sheets&#8217; assets and liabilities to income statements&#8217; revenues and expenses is subject to
managers&#8217; (sometimes &ldquo;creative&rdquo;) interpretation. In publicly-held firms, financial statements are
important to shareholders who use them to assess the performance of their investments. This
requires management, however, to report financials that reflect reality. In truth, management can
use accounting concepts such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Management,_Inc#Accounting_scandal">depreciation</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization#Risks_to_investors">asset securitization</a> (aka CDOs), and
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/05/062405.asp">expense capitalization</a> to distort a firm&rsquo;s performance or just straight-up lie.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have a chunk of disposable income in your pocket, and instead of splurging on the
newest tech gadget or Gucci handbag, you decide to invest it in stocks. How do you pick a good
one? Bad <a href="news:">news:</a> 99% of people have no idea, including all those fund managers who are paid millions
in fees to pretend like they know. So, of course, this post won&rsquo;t tell you how to invest your
money, but you may learn what to watch out for. One of the things to be aware of is telling
responsible managers apart from false promoters.</p>

<p>I recommend you start by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060555661">The Intelligent Investor</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham">Benjamin Graham</a>, an
American economist and the father of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing">value investing</a>. If you get this edition with Jason
Zweig&rsquo;s commentary, you&rsquo;ll learn that trustworthy managers are those who don&rsquo;t pander to the
investing public or act as &ldquo;hype-o-chondriacs&rdquo; spewing glowing press releases. Zweig gives advice
such as checking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_4">Form 4</a> on <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml">EDGAR</a>, a public, online database of corporate financial
information, for repeated big sales of equity by senior executives. If executives don&rsquo;t put their
money where their mouths are, why should you?</p>

<p>Other things to be on the lookout for:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-recurring charges that recur consistently</li>
<li>&ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; items so frequent they become ordinary</li>
<li><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp">EBITDA</a> that appears more than net income</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2063953/">pro forma</a>&rdquo; earnings that cover actual losses</li>
</ul>


<p>Although my professor made accounting fun, I think it can be taught in a more exciting way. Think
<em>CSI – Forensic Accounting</em>. Begin the class by slapping a transparency of
<a href="http://picker.uchicago.edu/Enron/EnronAnnualReport2000.pdf">Enron&rsquo;s 2000 balance sheet</a> on the overhead projector. The professor&rsquo;s first words to the
class: &ldquo;Can anybody tell me what this is?&rdquo; A student raises his/her hand and answers, &ldquo;A balance
sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; The professor would reply. &ldquo;This is a crime scene. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/12/business/enron-s-plan-would-repay-a-fraction-of-dollars-owed.html">deceived creditors</a> and
<a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article423518.ece">destroyed the life-savings</a> of thousands of Enron employees. This is the scene of unchecked
greed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be an amazing course? I would totally take this course.</p>
