Read the post that <a href="/2010/09/citibanks-advice-to-women-part-3" title="Citibanks advice to women part 3">continues it</a>**.</em></p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TBMJv3pABdI/AAAAAAAAAVs/aZtwyHSSKLo/s800/Citibank%27s%20Advice%20to%20Women.jpg" width="510" height="762" title="11. Grow Testicles" alt="Citi"><div class='caption'>11. Grow Testicles</div></div>


<p><strong>[update]</strong> Commenter &ldquo;Jessica&rdquo; wrote on the <a href="/2010/08/citibanks-advice-to-women-grow-a-pair#comment-390" title="citibanks advice to women grow a pair">previous post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a female employee at Citi, I have one of these on my desk. They were NOT handed out by the HR
  department, but rather by the Head of Diversity, Patricia David, who is no longer with the firm.
  (Currently at JP Morgan I believe.) They are handed out at workshops geared towards women, often
  hosted by &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Councils&rdquo; that exist in various Citi locations.</p></blockquote>

<p>When a friend who interviewed at Citibank showed me the card above, we shared it among friends and
laughed at its ridiculousness on so many levels. I posted a photo of the card <a href="/2010/09/citibanks-advice-to-women-grow-a-pair" title="Citibanks advice to women grow a pair">here</a> but didn&rsquo;t
think it would get much of a response. I was right. It languished in my sad, little corner of the
Internet garnering a only a few hits. Two days ago, a friend who reads the online business tabloid
<a href="http://dealbreaker.com/">Dealbreaker</a>, told me to send my post to Dealbreaker editor Bess Levin.</p>

<blockquote><p>You know that post about the tips to women from Citigroup?? If I may, I think you should send a
  link of that post over to Bess Levin at Dealbreaker. It is perfect for her and if I remember, she
  has not uncovered that piece of paper yet. She loves to pick up on women in finance stuff AND she
  likes to make fun of citigroup. She will definitely link from Dealbreaker to your blog, which will
  get you viewership.</p></blockquote>

<p>I shot Ms. Levin an hopeful e-mail, and she responded, &ldquo;wow&hellip;is that real??&rdquo; I said I&rsquo;m neither
creative enough to come up with ten whole bullet points or motivated enough to print and laminate
the card. Coming up with <a href="/2010/09/creative-ways-to-say-happy-birthday" title="creative ways to say happy birthday">something for a birthday card</a> is hard enough. And if the photo was a
hoax, don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d catch the &ldquo;therefore you <em>are not get</em> taken seriously&rdquo; typo in #7. Come
on, Citi. Can&rsquo;t you spare some i-banking analysts from writing prospectus summaries to spellcheck
that card?</p>

<p>Ms. Levin agreed to post the photo and link back to my blog. The blogosphere&rsquo;s response has been,
to put it lightly, somewhat loud:</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_lgMz7QRk66k/TIsMlHDEnBI/AAAAAAAAAgk/YAG6EHMZoZg/s800/Picture-3.png" width="510" height="265" title="Traffic to my blog." alt="How to write a viral blog post"><div class='caption'>Traffic to my blog.</div></div>


<p>It started on <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2010/09/citi-advocates-that-female-employees-do-not-sit-with-their-legs-crossed-but-rather-spread-eagle-with-their-balls-hanging-out/">Dealbreaker</a> where comments ranged from</p>

<blockquote><p>#11 -Typically give terrible head in the conference room.</p></blockquote>

<p>to</p>

<blockquote><p>Yeah, right? I mean wtf? If I were a competent female Citigroup employee I&rsquo;d be seriously po&rsquo;d
  at this. Totally insulting. A woman doesn&rsquo;t get ahead in this biz by acting like a douchebag guy
  with no sense of humor. She gets ahead like anyone else– being good at her JOB.</p>

<p>Being well dressed and hot is also a plus, especially if you&rsquo;re in a client/counterparty facing
  role.</p>

<p>-a heterosexual WASP who is amazed he&rsquo;s actually commenting like this but anyway</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://jezebel.com/5634959/citibank-hr-tells-ladies-how-to-succeed-at-work">Jezebel</a>, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/citibank_wants_its_female_employees.php">Gothamist</a>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/citibank-presents-the-top-10-ways-women-sabotage-their-careers-2010-9">Business Insider</a>, <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/23966">Big Think</a>, and even the
<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/09/a-primer-for-women-in-banking.html">LA Times blog</a> posted the photo. So I got my first viral blog post. My fifteen seconds of
fame in the blogosphere brings mixed feelings, however. Hell, this even provoked a comment from a
Citi spokesperson, according to the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/09/a-primer-for-women-in-banking.html">LA Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Citi spokesperson said, &ldquo;The material in question is not part of Citi&rsquo;s formal leadership
  training or human resources communications. It appears to have been taken from a published book by
  a noted author in the field of executive coaching.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>My rationale and defense for posting the photo rests on the fact that this card is not
confidential information and it&rsquo;s&hellip;thought-provoking. Releasing something like this on the web, the
wild, wild west of all mediums, however, has the danger of distortion and exaggeration. Just
imagine a game of telephone with thousands of people, some don&rsquo;t listen carefully while others are
just mildly retarded. So I clarified some things with my source who passed me the photo.</p>

<p>According to my friend, this card was on some of the desks on a floor he <strong>suspects</strong> was the
human resources department. It is unclear how these cards fit in with official company training
material, how widely and to which employees Citibank distributed them, or the financial
institution&rsquo;s broader policy towards women in the workplace. I personally don&rsquo;t doubt that
Citibank takes its treatment of female employees very seriously and that this card was handed out
with the best of intentions.</p>
