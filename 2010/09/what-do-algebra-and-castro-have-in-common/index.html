  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do algebra and Castro have in common? What are Columbia&rsquo;s Contemporary Civilization class
discussions really like? And what&rsquo;s the secret weapon of white male Republicans? Here&rsquo;s some more
hilarious quotes I dug up.</p>

<ul>
<li>God created the integers; all else is the work of man. – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a><br/>
So maybe God lives in Arabia. – <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~neumann/">Professor Walter Neumann</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals#Origins">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/fac-bios/Gallagher/faculty.html">Professor Patrick Gallagher</a>: [writing a math proof on blackboard, suddenly stops] It&rsquo;s like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_Will_Absolve_Me">Fidel Castro</a> once said, &#8221;History will absolve me.&ldquo; And likewise we get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism">homomorphism</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://patrickzimmerli.com/">Patrick Zimmerli</a> was a lecturer for my beginning music theory course. In addition to being
upbeat and nice, he was eccentric and hilarious. He encouraged students to dress up on Wednesdays,
which he declared &ldquo;snazzy-Wednesday.&rdquo; He playfully embarrassed by making us sing chords, which he
said helped him relax after a long day. And he told us to call him &ldquo;PZ.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>PZ to female student Susan who&rsquo;s wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimple">wimple</a>, on a Wednesday at that: Wow, you&rsquo;re
really hot and on. [The class laughs nervously.] Oh, was that not appropriate for me to say?</li>
<li>The New York Philharmonic used to be the New York Philharmonic Society – lovers of music. Now
they just get paid to be yuppies.</li>
<li>I am inclined to let this discussion go on, but I&rsquo;m just going to end it. We will discuss this
at 2AM while ingesting hallucinogenics. – PZ interrupting a pre-class discussion on whether
glasses makes one&rsquo;s vision worse.</li>
<li>Is that &ldquo;merch&rdquo;? – PZ asking about the shirt of a female student who&rsquo;s a member of Columbia&rsquo;s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra">Bhangra</a> student group</li>
<li>The brain is not for thinking. Remember that. – PZ</li>
<li>For those of you who find this unbelievably boring just sit there eand think about whether we
should countinue the human species in its current condition. – PZ after some students have trouble
with 4-part reduction.</li>
</ul>


<p>Columbia&rsquo;s philosophy classes are the paragon of intellectual discourse.</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you have against happiness! - an indignant student on Kant&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521626951?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521626951">Groundwork on the Metaphysics of Morals</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=easiamus00-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0521626951" alt="" /> during Columbia&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/classes/cc.php">Contemporary Civilization</a> course</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to assume they were women. – Contemporary Civilization Professor DEL
after Nick makes a comment about Adam Smith&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process#Adam_Smith">pin factory</a> and refers to the factory workers
as &ldquo;pin ladies&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sorry, I was totally channelling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Riveter">Rosie the Riveter</a> that whole time. – Nick</li>
<li>Okay, Chris. You are not allowed to bring up eunuchs for the rest of the section. – teaching
assistant Buyun during a Chinese history class discussion section</li>
</ul>


<p>Chinese language class cracked me up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Big girl have big dream. Tell me your dreams and aspirations. You can say whatever. This is
Chinese class so just say them even though they probably won&rsquo;t come true. – first-year Chinese
language class lecturer Jia Liu</li>
<li>Although she&rsquo;s very beautiful, no one likes her. - Chinese language class exercise<br/>
Why is that? – Jia Liu asks class<br/>
Because she&rsquo;s bitch. – female student Ruoxi out of left-field</li>
</ul>


<p>Who else brought a pillow to Columbia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sciencecore.columbia.edu/">Frontiers of Science</a> lectures?</p>

<ul>
<li>I think if you&rsquo;re teaching climate change it&rsquo;s counter-productive to give everyone a copy of
the worksheets. – <a href="http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~sharmila/">Sharmila Kamat</a> on saving the Earth one handout at a time</li>
</ul>


<p>Sometimes I wish I were still M.K.&rsquo;s roommate.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not wearing a diaper because I don&rsquo;t want gay people to rape me. – M.K. on why he&rsquo;s not
dressing up as a baby to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_Village_Halloween_Parade">Village Halloween parade</a></li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t wait to see James and Rachel hook up. – M.K. on James&#8217; newfound intensity</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m gonna fuck your mom in the ear. – M.K.&rsquo;s retort to Eric&rsquo;s &ldquo;yo mama&rdquo; jokes</li>
<li>I know that shit is real because they film it in my stomach. – M.K. about Pinky and the Brain</li>
<li>The things I do for my mom&hellip;she really appreciates me. – M.K. about his mother</li>
<li>I read somewhere that the chances of your vote counting is one out of five billion. – M.K. on
the futility of voting</li>
</ul>


<p>Keep some people in your life for their entertainment value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama has won the election. Attn: all white people report to the cotton fields tomorrow morning.
– Phillip H. text message to Joseph Y.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re interested in someone as more than a friend, even if it&rsquo;s somewhere down the line, you
should want to bone them. – Mishi C.</li>
<li>Have you gone off every exit in New Hampshire? – Margaret W. I have actually explored the
surrounding countryside, motherfuckers! – Seth D.</li>
</ul>


<p>Do you realize you&rsquo;re speaking to reporters on tape?</p>

<ul>
<li>Misfortune is a spectator sport nowadays&hellip;Even white male republicans are using it. – former
Barnard College President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Shapiro">Judith Shapiro</a><br/>
It&rsquo;s the only way they can get elected. – former Barnard Dean <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/06/04/barnards-denburg-step-down-dean-vp-job">Dorothy Denburg</a></li>
