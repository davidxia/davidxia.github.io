  <div class="entry-content"><p>My suitemate during senior year of college once told me a concise yet insightful piece of
political wisdom from his experience of volunteering on the John Kerry presidential campaign. He
said political know-nothings often think political campaigns are based on principles, ideology,
and clear-cut policies. In reality, political campaigns are run like military engagements.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My friend&rsquo;s a smart guy so I took his word for it. But I didn&rsquo;t know how right he was until I
finished watching seasons 3-5 of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BZ5AFU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=easiamus00-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004BZ5AFU">The Wire</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=easiamus00-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004BZ5AFU" alt="" /></em>. I&rsquo;ve learned more from <em>The Wire</em> about
urban political machines and political posturing than I&rsquo;ve ever grasped from the news.</p>

<p>One particularly memorable scene from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unto_Others#Politics">season 4 episode 7 </a>involves newly elected Baltimore
mayor Tommy Carcetti having lunch with an older mentor who was a former Baltimore mayor. Carcetti&rsquo;s
mentor Tony warns him:</p>

<iframe class="fill-width" width="540" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjzqO6UOPFQ"
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<blockquote><p>Tony: All you have to do now is run the city.</p>

<p>Tommy: Tony, I gotta ask you something. Why didn&rsquo;t you run again after the first term? Nobody
  had the name you had, the organization&hellip;</p>

<p>Tony: Let me tell you a story, Tommy. The first day I became mayor, they sit me down at the desk.
  Beech chair, dark wood, lots of beautiful things. I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;How much better can it get?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s
  a knock at the door in the corner of the room, and Pete comes walking in carrying this gorgeous
  sieve silver bowl, hand-chased to this big [motions with hands]. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the unions,&rdquo; he says.
  So I think it&rsquo;s a present – something to commemorate my first day as mayor.</p>

<p>He walks over, puts it on the desk. I look down at it. It&rsquo;s disgusting! I say, &ldquo;What the hell is
  this?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s it look like?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It looks like shit. Well, what do you
  want me to do with it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Eat it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Eat it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;re the mayor. You gotta
  eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, okay, it was my first day. Pete knows more than I do. So I go at it. And just when I finish,
  there&rsquo;s a knock on the door. And in walks Pete carrying another silver bowl. And this one&rsquo;s from
  the blacks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This too?&rdquo; And he nods. I start eating, and when I finish, there&rsquo;s another knock and another
  bowl. This one&rsquo;s from the Polacks. And after that, one from the ministers. And you know what, Tommy,
  that&rsquo;s what it is. You&rsquo;re sitting, eating shit all day long, day after day, year after year. When
  I realized that, I decided being a downtown lawyer and seeing my family every night made for a
  fine life. Just a fine life.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised President Obama said <em>The Wire</em> was <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jan/14/obama-gloves-off/">his favorite</a> television show. We all
know he&rsquo;s had his share of shit bowls to eat from. Mmm, tastes like crude oil.</p>
