  <div class="entry-content"><p>China&rsquo;s Xinhua News Agency started a 24-hour English-language news channel and is about to open a
new office in New York City, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?_r=1&amp;hp">according to the </a><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?_r=1&amp;hp">Times</a></em>. The <em>Times</em> is once again
critical of China. And they should be. China ranks 168th out of 175 countries in the 2009
<a href="http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&amp;id_rubrique=1001">Press Freedom Index</a>, a survey compiled by <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a>. What I don&rsquo;t like
about the <em>Times</em> article is its prejudicial sense of nationalism and simplistic view of East vs
West.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> inflated the article by making it sound as if Xinhua Red Guards wielding hammers and
sickles are about to kick down the sacred doors of Western media companies.</p>

<!--more-->




<blockquote><p>On Thursday, an official with Xinhua, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to talk to the press, said Xinhua was planning to build a newsroom at the top of a
44-story skyscraper in Times Square, giving it an address in the same neighborhood as Reuters,
Conde Nast, News Corp and The New York Times.</p><footer><strong>New York Times</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/world/asia/02china.html'>www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/asia/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>The agency already has more than 10,000 employees and 120 bureaus around the world, rivaling the
  reach, if not the quality, of Western news services like Reuters or Bloomberg.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the US currently has six broadcast operations comparable to China&rsquo;s own
propaganda mouthpieces: Voice of America, Radio Free Europe which targets Eastern Europe, Radio
Sawa and Al Hurra which focus on the Middle East, and Radio Marti on Cuba. Many of these have been
accused of dishing out propaganda rather than balanced reporting. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_america#VOA_as_a_propaganda_tool">here</a>, Lee Bollinger&rsquo;s
book <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3OQvTPTkCsWAlAfz8uGkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Uninhibited, Robust, and Wide-open</a></em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3OQvTPTkCsWAlAfz8uGkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> </a>page 102, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_hurra#Criticisms_of_Alhurra">here</a>. You&rsquo;ve probably never
heard of these media outlets. I hadn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s because they direct their news outwards to citizens
of other countries in an effort to combat local anti-American rhetoric and try to win the native
people&rsquo;s hearts and minds. Taking these federally financed media operations into account with the
<em>Times</em> article about Xinhua, things suddenly aren&rsquo;t so black and white.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> reported that the Chinese government has spent lots of money expanding their
state-controlled TV stations and newspapers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Xinhua&rsquo;s move is just one of several planned by Beijing. China Central Television, the country&rsquo;s
  biggest state-run television broadcaster, has also been expanding overseas and offering broadcasts
  in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and other languages. And China has heavily financed a makeover
  of China Daily, its English-language daily newspaper, and introduced a new English edition of
  Global Times, which is controlled by People&rsquo;s Daily, the leading Communist Party-run newspaper.</p></blockquote>

<p>Astounding fact: &ldquo;the various US government-sponsored international broadcast
channels&hellip;collectively received $671 million in government funds in 2008″ (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Uninhibited</a></em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MmQ-DCPzM5UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=uninhibited-robust-and-wide-open&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">, 102</a>).</p>

<p>I wonder how much China&rsquo;s government has allocated to their state-sponsored broadcast
channels&hellip;Perhaps the <em>Times</em> should&rsquo;ve made a comparison not between Xinhua and privately-owned
media companies but between Xinhua and US-sponsored media outlets.</p>

<p>I can see why the <em>Times</em> portrayed the story this way. I don&rsquo;t know if they still have a hiring
freeze, but the media industry&rsquo;s financial pain is only increasing these days. They see a media
company with little press freedom and sense of public accountability funded by a rising economic
albeit authoritarian government setting up shop in their backyard. I&rsquo;d be scared.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been talk of turning media companies into non-profits. For the better half of the 20th
century, corporate board rooms have sucked profit from newspapers instead of plowing them back
into the business. Just another instance of short-term gain overpowering long-term prudence and
stewardship. Now with newsrooms eviscerated from rounds of buyouts, some journalists and editors
are thinking of alternate financial models: 501(3)c non-profits, money from foundations,
tax-deductible donations, and even government funding allocated by independent bodies (like the
National Institutes of Health handing out grants for biomedical research). I point you to a report
called <em><a href="http://www.cjr.org/reconstruction/the_reconstruction_of_american.php?page=all">The Reconstruction of American Journalism</a>.</em></p>

<p>The ultimate irony to the <em>Times</em> story is that journalism in the US could eventually be funded in
such a way that the federal government plays a big role in propping them up. Some journalists balk
at the idea while others are holding their noses while considering it.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, I point you to the 2010 White House Correspondents Dinner.</p>

<blockquote><p>People say to me, &#8220;Mr. President. You helped revive the banking industry. You&#8217;ve saved GM and
Chrysler. What about the news business?&#8221; I have to explain, &#8220;Hey. I&#8217;m just the President. I&#8217;m not
a miracle worker here.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>2010 White House Correspondents Dinner</strong> <cite><a href='http://youtu.be/JP5k4n6Wnc4?t=2m46s'>youtu.be/JP5k4n6Wnc4?t=2m46s/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
