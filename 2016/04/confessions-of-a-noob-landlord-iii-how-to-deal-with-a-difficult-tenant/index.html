  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s say your parents own and rent out a couple of condominium units in the greater Boston area.
The lease is about to expire for one of the units that&rsquo;s rented out to a young Polish woman who is
a student.</p>

<p>Your mother Nancy emails the tenant, who we&rsquo;ll call Ashley to protect her real identity
and also because we all know a crazy girl who happens to have that name, several months ahead of
time to ask if she&rsquo;d
like to renew for another year given a monthly rent increase of $50. According to your mom, Ashley
implied she would sign the new lease, but it&rsquo;s been a couple of months and she hasn&rsquo;t sent a
signed copy back yet.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Ashley wrote an email complaining of multiple problems with
the apartment that she&rsquo;s never mentioned before. So what should your parents do?</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a guide on exactly how they should handle the situation. Tell their unhinged
broker Joe to deal with the crazy tenant and watch the situation spiral out of control.
All emails below are copy-pasted verbatim.</p>

<p><em>My parents have learned from this experience and no longer work with either tenant or broker.</em></p>

<p>The mice have taken over my house. I don&rsquo;t know how this happened. There are Many holes. I mean I
painted the whole house.i cleaned it for over 60 hours when I moved in . I tried to over up with
tape. I&rsquo;m sorry to be this way but most apartment don&rsquo;t have these issues. I googled the apartment
and they are all new so for 1400 in my building clean and nice but this is my home. I don&rsquo;t want
to move..just ask for help and help</p>

<ol>
<li>so much mildew I cough daily all over walls</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been at peace with mice living with me. I clean daily.</li>
<li>bug problems I find at least 4 centipedes in my shower when window are closed.</li>
<li>the pipes of the shower are collapsing and the 1920 bathtub is gathering chemicals</li>
<li>I had the bathtub inspected and it has to be replaced due to cancer components  such as iron
and magnesium</li>
</ol>

<p>Ashley&rsquo;s father calls your parents and leaves a voicemail with the same list of complaints
and adds that they had inspections done in the apartment. So your mom calls his bluff.
She says she&rsquo;d like to see the inspection reports, and if they&rsquo;re true, can&rsquo;t let any tenants live
there until the problems resolved.</p>

<p>Hi Ashley,</p>

<p>Please send any communications regarding your rental via email to me. Please advise your dad of
the same. These are sensitive issues so I want to make sure we are all on the same page and that
none of my communications to you are misconstrued. Not trying to be standoffish.<br/>
I do not have access to my voicemail right now, I see that you had left me one. Can you please
send me an email with the content of that voicemail? Much appreciated, have a great rest of the
night.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for any miss communication. I left you guys voicemails but I don&rsquo;t want to be evicted. I
love my house and treat it like my own. Don&rsquo;t kick me out Nancy. There was NO inspection simply I
have a pest issue meaning mice are living in my sofa, bedroom, etc. I&rsquo;m a good tenant please don&rsquo;t
make me leave. Sorry I said there was mice I&rsquo;ll handle it on my own.</p>

<p>You are really reaching now Ashley. Thousands of dollars? Really? Really, really??</p>

<p>First of all, we need the name and contact info of the plumber that you had come by.</p>

<p>Second of all, let&rsquo;s see the receipts for the thousands of dollars you say you spent to clean the
place up.</p>

<p>None of this came up on the apartment condition statement.</p>

<p>I have advised Nancy that we need to get in there ASAP to address all of the issues you are
outlining, no matter if you stay or if you go.</p>

<p>See you soon.</p>

<p>China was never really communist. Same goes for the former Soviet Union.</p>

<p>I can hear the violins now.</p>

<p>I have no &ldquo;man ego&rdquo;, I am too well-adjusted for that kind of thing. You probably don&rsquo;t understand
because you falsely assume all men are alike.</p>

<p>Where is the &ldquo;barbaric email&rdquo; that your friend sent and who is it addressed to?</p>

<p>You call the police once a week and we don&rsquo;t even know about it?????????? Nor the management
company?????????????</p>

<p>I am 100% certain that my education served me well, I went to a wicked good university too.
And was smart enough to break away from the yoke they created.</p>

<p>No one is saying that you are/were a bad tenant,</p>

<p>You are trying to simultaneously negotiate your rent down and lay a laundry list of issues on
Nancy&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>My team member will be taking over for me regarding you and this issue. Fortunately, I will be
dealing with the rental part of it. I copied her on this email.</p>

<p>Joe,</p>

<p>I found the email. I know who sent it. Someone trying to ruin me. There is no cancerous bacteria
in my tub!!! Magnesium?! I understand why this all got into a fight. I&rsquo;m sorry for disrespecting
both of you with my words. I truly am sorry for taking it this far.</p>

<p>I will be out August 31st. I apologize for being rude and immature. I&rsquo;m very hurt someone took my
phone and said cancer is in my bathtub. I&rsquo;m sorry my hormones took over my mouth. We will be in
contact for financial reasons only.</p>

<p>Took your phone? Cancer in the bathtub?
You lost me on that one.</p>

<p>I guess it is just that I am so decrepit, old, and bald, I certainly would not be able to use
hormones as an excuse.</p>

<p>Hi Ashley,</p>

<p>My team member, Sara, volunteered to take over my spot in this little spat we are having.<br/>
I acquiesced but then changed my mind.</p>

<p>A few days later Joe followed up with this last email.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Dog Day Afternoon</p>

<p>Hi Ash,</p>

<p>I heard that you have a dog up there from time to time. There are no pets allowed, not even
temporarily. It is safe to say that Nancy and I are on the same page and we are the antithesis of
dog people. Nothing personal but there&rsquo;s no pet policy, that includes when your dad visits.</p>

<p>Also, I would appreciate you keeping your dad chilled out or I will have to, by any and all means
necessary.</p>

<p>I will be monitoring the pet situation and if I find there is a dog (or even a pet amoeba) for
more than half of a millisecond I will have to call animal control. I&rsquo;m not sensitive to their
feelings, only human feelings.</p>

<p>No pets means no pets. There are no special rights or Bill of Rights for animals and we have an
agreement that you would not have them up there. End of story. (Nancy saw the water bowl and
food.) if you sit the dog while your dad is away then I would seriously consider a local pet
hotel, I just rented a 10,000 square-foot facility for such a use and would be happy to refer you
to them.</p>

<p>Please be very careful about the language you use when you write back the obligatory responses you
have been delivering to me. I will be sending any and all correspondence to my in-house lawyer.
Not any type of threat at all, but you are a handful.</p>

<p>See you at 7 PM tonight. Everything will be calm and lovely but I have to follow up on the claims
you made a few days ago.</p>
