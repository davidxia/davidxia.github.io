  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished planning a vacation I&rsquo;ll take with my parents through the southern parts of the UK.
Here&rsquo;s our itinerary in case anyone else finds it useful. I spent a day researching the worthwhile
destinations close to London.</p>

<p>This itinerary is an opinionated one. I left out Stonehenge (forums
said that unless I&rsquo;m really into anthropology, it&rsquo;ll just be a pile of big rocks to me), chose
Cambridge instead of Oxford (they&rsquo;re similar and Cambridge has the magnificent King&rsquo;s College
Chapel), and opted for the Seven Sisters over the White Cliffs of Dover (I found out the White
Cliffs aren&rsquo;t that white anymore).</p>

<p>The only undecided part of this itinerary is whether and where to get the rental car for the
Jurassic Coast. Let me know if you have good ideas.</p>

<h2>March 22 - Seven Sisters (1.5hr from London)</h2>

<blockquote><p>The Seven Sisters is a series of chalk cliffs by the English Channel. They form part of the South
Downs in East Sussex, between the towns of Seaford and Eastbourne in southern England. They
are within the Seven Sisters Country Park which is bounded by the coast, the Cuckmere and
the A259 road. They are the remnants of dry valleys in the chalk South Downs, which are
gradually being eroded by the sea.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters,_Sussex'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<h2>March 23 - Blenheim Palace (2hr from London)</h2>

<blockquote><p>Designed in the rare, and short-lived, English Baroque style, architectural appreciation of the
palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s. It is unique in its combined usage as a
family home, mausoleum and national monument. The palace is also notable as the birthplace and
ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>March 24 and 25 - Jurassic Coast</h2>

<blockquote><p>The Jurassic Coast is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It
stretches from Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in
East Dorset, a distance of 96 miles (155 kilometres). Chartered in 2001, the Jurassic coast
was the second wholly natural World Heritage Site to be designated in the United Kingdom. Its
entire length can be walked on the South West Coast Path. The site was featured on the
television programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the South West (of the
UK), and in a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, the Jurassic Coast was named as the
fifth-greatest natural wonder in Britain.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
