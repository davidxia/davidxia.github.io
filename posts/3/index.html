  <div class="entry-content"><p>I visited the southern UK with my parents last March. We visited the coast where I took a photo of the
English Channel and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidxia2/posts/10102320113525692">posted it on Facebook</a> with the caption,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking across the English Channel now wondering if I have what it takes to swim across to
France. It&rsquo;s 21 miles across at its narrowest point and the fastest swimmer made it across in a
little over seven hours and the slowest one was 27 hours. Average water temperatures in the summer
are 14-18 degrees Celsius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My high school swim coach Jen saw it and said, &ldquo;If you are seriously considering, let me know &mdash; I
have many friends who have done this swim (yes I hang out with weirdos)!&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s start with
something a bit more realistic I said. Jen encouraged me to participate in the annual Wayland Three
Mile Swim which she organizes. The race takes place in Lake Cochituate, a small body of water in
Wayland, Massachusetts which borders my hometown of Wellesley.</p>

<p>So I <a href="https://www.davidxia.com/2016/04/when-routine-becomes-ritual/">trained religiously</a> for three months. A couple of days before June 19,
I took a bus from New York City back to Wellesley for the open water swim that would start at
7:30AM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had some strange swimming experiences.</p>

<p>In 2012 I vacationed on a tiny cay in Belize with a group of college friends.
The island was so small that its surface area was probably equal to that of a  medium-sized suburban
house. An even smaller cay lay a quarter of a mile away with nothing but white sand, coral
reefs, and pristine blue water separating them. One day I decided to swim to the smaller island
and back. I wore a long-sleeved shirt and pants to not get sunburned and waded into the water with
my snorkel mask. I carefully made my way around the sharp corals near the island. Once the water
became deep enough, I was surrounded by nothing but deep blue water.
I couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom or any distinguishable shapes in the ocean.</p>

<div class='image center'><img  src="https://i.imgur.com/LDg8qfd.jpg" width="640" height="322" title="Photo by Todd Quackenbush is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0" ><div class='caption'>Photo by Todd Quackenbush is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</div></div>


<p>I started seeing ghostly shapes swimming around me. I was scared because I
wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was seeing large fish or if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.
I had seen barricudas, rays, and sharks in the water on previous days. I kept swimming. By now I
was halfway to the other island. After about 20 minutes I reached shore.
The ocean&rsquo;s depths and creatures made me feel naked and vulnerable and at times like I
was going crazy. But I stuck it out and felt strangely triumphant afterwards.</p>

<p>I was six and attending summer camp. The counselors occasionally took us to the Evelyn Kirrane Aquatics
Center in Brookline, Massachusetts. One day I stepped into the deep-end of a pool without knowing
and began to panic. I tried screaming but couldn&rsquo;t get my mouth out of the water long enough to
take a breath and exhale. I started gulping a lot of water. Luckily, it was a small pool, and I
eventually made my way to the wall. I was surprised, however, that I couldn&rsquo;t signal for help and
that no one seemed to notice my distress. Later in life I learned it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ribride.co.uk/blog/drowning-does-not-look-like-drowning/" title="A Drowning Person Does Not Look Like a Drowning Person">difficult for an untrained
person to notice that someone is drowning</a>. Many small children drown each year just a short
distance away from their parents.</p>

<p>I lap swim regularly at the Chelsea Recreation Center. Multiple swimmers share a single lane by
swimming counter-clockwise. One day, another swimmer was swimming towards me in the opposite direction.
According to the rules, we each stuck to our respective right-hand sides. He must&rsquo;ve been a large
person because his wake was bigger than I&rsquo;m used to. I tilted my head to the side and took a breath
just as his wake hit me. Water unexpectedly entered my mouth and nose. I was surprised by how my
brain went into auto-pilot emergency mode. I tensed up and began to flail involuntarily.
The water and lack of breath was a strong signal to my brain that overrode everything else.</p>

The events below transpired in New York City. The buying process may be different in other areas,

<li>My mother found an affordable co-op unit for sale while browsing StreetEasy on her iPad
during Christmas vacation in 2015.</li>
<li>We noticed the listing was made by the seller himself. I emailed him that night.</li>
<li>The seller promptly called me. I scheduled a viewing of the unit which is at the top
of a six-floor walk-up.</li>
<li>My parents and I climbed the six flights of stairs and met the seller who was a nice man named
Alan. We walked around and inspected his unit.</li>
<li>We asked Alan about the apartment&rsquo;s condition, the co-op&rsquo;s financials and rules, the property
manager, etc.</li>
<li>We sat down with Alan, chatted, and negotiated. My mother pointed out neither party has a broker
which is good because brokers take a 6% commission. We felt out Alan on how many offers he&rsquo;s
received and what they are.</li>
<li>My mother verbally offered Alan 94% of the listing price. He said he&rsquo;ll see. My mom seemed
confident he&rsquo;d take it. I was impressed by her ability to knock off over $20K right off the bat.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been four years since I started working at Spotify. Every Friday, the
Technology, Product, and Design group at Spotify&rsquo;s New York City office
gathers to eat freshly catered snacks, introduce new hires, announce &ldquo;wins of the week,&rdquo; and
commemorate the anniversaries of existing employees.</p>

<p>Last Friday was my turn to stand before the couple hundred members of TPD. It&rsquo;s customary for people
celebrating their employment anniversaries to speak about their favorite Spotify memory.
I don&rsquo;t get many chances to address so many of my colleagues at
once. So I took this opportunity to prepare a short statement. It went something like this.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s my favorite Spotify memory? I have a hard time with this question because I don&rsquo;t have a
good answer. There&rsquo;s so many.</p>

<p>I find another question more interesting. That question is, &ldquo;What, after four years, makes me look
forward to getting up every weekday morning and working at Spotify?&rdquo; Four years is a long time to
be doing anything continuously.</p>

<p>I can tell you what&rsquo;s not the main reason. It&rsquo;s not the snacks or perks or the amazing office.
It&rsquo;s not even Celebration X [Spotify&rsquo;s massive 10-year anniversary party in Stockholm].
These are all great things, but they&rsquo;re not the main reason I show up everyday.</p>

<p>The main reason is values. I&rsquo;ve never been at a place where I share so many values with my
colleagues and the company. My teammates like Matt and Staffan and Mats share my values of hard
work, competence, and personal responsibility (and beer). The company constantly strives to become
a better version of itself through being risk-taking, passion, and compassion.</p>

<p>Every day is a new memory. Every day I feel blessed to be here working with all of you. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On April 16, seven friends and I went skydiving at Skydive the Ranch in New Jersey. We rented
a black SUV (a Hyundai that had terrible acceleration and braking) and each did a tandem dive.
It was a first for many of us including me.</p>

<p>My takeaway was that tandem diving out of a plane at 14-thousand feet is easy. The instructor takes
care of everything. I just had to sit back and enjoy the view. If anything went wrong and I died,
I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that bad about it because I wasn&rsquo;t the one who screwed it up.</p>

<p>Driving seven of your friends out of and back into New York City is nerve-wracking, on the other
hand. I was personally responsible for everyone&rsquo;s lives. Trying to return the rental car on time
while driving through Union Square in Manhattan where
there&rsquo;s a pedestrian fair going on, ambulances and cop cars, and drivers double parking wherever
they want is very stressful.</p>

<p>Hopefully Avis doesn&rsquo;t notice the small white scratch on the mirror of their mint condition car
(18 miles when I got it) that was left when I managed to squeeze through two city buses before they
crushed me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Thanks to Nanette for editing and agreeing to let me publish this and to my friends who gave me
feedback.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost 2016. Let&rsquo;s reset our relationship next year. OK?&rdquo; Nanette asked me two days before
Christmas Eve. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to say yes. I felt I would be lying.</p>

<p>I told Nanette we should break up. We spent the next two days crying until our eyes became red and
puffy. I had bought bus tickets for the night of Christmas Eve to travel back to my family in
Boston. It was cold and pouring that evening, but Nanette still accompanied me to the bus stop. I
got on the bus and asked her to go back home. She stood outside in the rain waiting for the driver
to pull out while looking at me through the windows. It broke my heart to see her standing on the
sidewalk, her tears mixing with the rain.</p>

<li>Wake up at 6:30AM.</li>
<li>Pound down a serving of Soylent since solid food will give me cramps in the pool.</li>
<li>Smell the chlorine. Try to put in at least 3,500 - 4,000 yards in the pool.
My back and arms are now fatigued.</li>
<li>Say hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/thepoetofharlem">Musa Kaleem Keita</a>. Realize I&rsquo;m talking to someone who personally knew prominent
African Americans like <a href="https://youtu.be/fOvU2FqrVhY">Muhammed Ali</a> and O.J. Simpson. Ask him if he&rsquo;s seen the recent true crime
show called &ldquo;The People v. O.J. Simpson.&rdquo; Realize after a few minutes of talking to Musa, that
white and black America view the things very differently. Get reminded of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s reaction
to the O.J. Simpson verdict.

<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>Americans see the world differently, generally, based on their race, that troubles me.
I think the only answer to that is for us to spend more time listening to each other and try
to put ourselves in each others shoes and understand why we see the world in different ways
and keep trying to overcome that. I would say that even though it&rsquo;s disturbing, we have
succeeded so far in managing the world&rsquo;s most multi-ethnic diverse democracy, better than a
lot of countries that are smaller than we are with fewer differences. - Bill Clinton</p></blockquote></li>

</li>
<li>Walk to Spotify and feel grateful I get to work at a company where I like what I do, my
colleagues, and the company culture.</li>
<li>By Friday, all that swimming has made me a tight wad of nerves and flesh. Trudge down to a
small Chinatown massage parlor where a masseur plies and kneads me until my muscles
open up again.</li>
<li>Realize on the weekends that I&rsquo;ve become the cheapest date on the planet. Refrain from
more than one or two drinks since I remember that time I finished swimming at night, had one beer,
and had a hangover the next morning.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost all of us have signed up for a free trial we then forgot to cancel
before getting charged for the next month or have felt uneasy entering credit card information
on a sketchy website. I discovered virtual credit card numbers several months ago and now use them
for both these cases.</p>

<p>Virtual credit card numbers (VCN) are credit card numbers that aren&rsquo;t associated with a physical
card. They are usually tied to your regular credit card account, and charges to the VCN will show
up on that credit card statement.</p>

<p>VCNs have two great features on top of regular credit card numbers. <strong>You can set the expiration and
maximum limit can be charged, and you can cancel them at any time.</strong> Let&rsquo;s say I want to try
<a href="https://www.spotify.com/premium/">Spotify Premium</a>. It&rsquo;s free for a month and $10 per month afterwards. I generate a VCN, set the limit
to $1 with an expiration of one month, enter that number into Spotify&rsquo;s website, and forget about
it. Use a VCN when you&rsquo;re wary that an online merchant might steal or is unable to protect your
card info as well.</p>

<p>So how does one get a VCN? The only free and bank-sponsored credit cards I know of that offer
them are <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/accounts-cards/shopsafe.go">Bank of America&rsquo;s ShopSafe feature</a> and <a href="https://www.cardbenefits.citi.com/products/virtual-account-numbers.aspx">Citibank&rsquo;s Virtual Account numbers</a>.
(<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-American-Express-discontinue-their-one-time-use-virtual-credit-card-numbers">Amex seems to have discontinued theirs.</a>)</p>

<p>There are cases when using a VCN might create more hassle than it&rsquo;s worth. The two I can think of
are booking a hotel room and needing to show your card when you arrive in person and returning a
purchase and trying to get a refund.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Please excuse the rambling nature of this post. It&rsquo;s more like a collection of thoughts mushed
together than a coherent essay.</em></p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> published an opinion piece a few weeks ago by a university cultural studies
instructor named Andrew Reiner about how conventional gender norms for
men in the US are restrictive and can harm not only women but also men themselves.
In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html">&ldquo;Teaching Men to be Emotionally Honest&rdquo;</a> Reiner said we teach boys from a young age what
emotions they are allowed to express. Boys are taught to convert their sadness or misery into anger;
vulnerability and compassion is best left to women and somehow makes a man less manly.</p>

<p>Reiner advocates for the creation of men&rsquo;s studies as an academic field
in its own right along with campus resource centers that would create &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; for guys.
He points out, however, that people can be skeptical of such efforts. A proposed <a href="http://thetyee.ca/News/2012/05/03/SFU-Mens-Centre/">Men&rsquo;s Centre at
Simon Fraser University</a> created debate over its intentions and usefulness.</p>

<blockquote><p>But wouldn&#8217;t encouraging men to embrace the full range of their humanity benefit women?
Why do we continue to limit the emotional lives of males when it serves no one?
This question is the rhetorical blueprint I pose to students before they begin what I call the
&#8220;Real Man&#8221; experiment.</p><footer><strong>Andrew Reiner</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html'>www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Reiner&rsquo;s piece makes me think about how masculinity has meant different things in different times
and places. Crying, for example, was more accepted in Greek heroes than it is in today&rsquo;s male
leaders. The <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19780_5-gender-stereotypes-that-used-to-be-exact-opposite.html">website Cracked.com says</a> (yes, I&rsquo;m quoting cracked.com),</p>

<blockquote><p>As recently as the 19th century, male tears were actually celebrated as a sign of honesty,
integrity and strength. And not in the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re brave enough to show your weakness&rdquo; way, but just
as a symbol that you actually gave a crap. And it probably also meant you were confident that no
one would mock you, since you had just won a battle or torn the limbs off of a monster with your
bare hands.</p></blockquote>
