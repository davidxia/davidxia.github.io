  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Thanks to Nanette for editing and agreeing to let me publish this and to my friends who gave me
feedback.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost 2016. Let&rsquo;s reset our relationship next year. OK?&rdquo; Nanette asked me two days before
Christmas Eve. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to say yes. I felt I would be lying.</p>

<p>I told Nanette we should break up. We spent the next two days crying until our eyes became red and
puffy. I had bought bus tickets for the night of Christmas Eve to travel back to my family in
Boston. It was cold and pouring that evening, but Nanette still accompanied me to the bus stop. I
got on the bus and asked her to go back home. She stood outside in the rain waiting for the driver
to pull out while looking at me through the windows. It broke my heart to see her standing on the
sidewalk, her tears mixing with the rain.</p>

<li>Wake up at 6:30AM.</li>
<li>Pound down a serving of Soylent since solid food will give me cramps in the pool.</li>
<li>Smell the chlorine. Try to put in at least 3,500 - 4,000 yards in the pool.
My back and arms are now fatigued.</li>
<li>Say hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/thepoetofharlem">Musa Kaleem Keita</a>. Realize I&rsquo;m talking to someone who personally knew prominent
African Americans like <a href="https://youtu.be/fOvU2FqrVhY">Muhammed Ali</a> and O.J. Simpson. Ask him if he&rsquo;s seen the recent true crime
show called &ldquo;The People v. O.J. Simpson.&rdquo; Realize after a few minutes of talking to Musa, that
white and black America view the things very differently. Get reminded of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s reaction
to the O.J. Simpson verdict.

<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>Americans see the world differently, generally, based on their race, that troubles me.
I think the only answer to that is for us to spend more time listening to each other and try
to put ourselves in each others shoes and understand why we see the world in different ways
and keep trying to overcome that. I would say that even though it&rsquo;s disturbing, we have
succeeded so far in managing the world&rsquo;s most multi-ethnic diverse democracy, better than a
lot of countries that are smaller than we are with fewer differences. - Bill Clinton</p></blockquote></li>

</li>
<li>Walk to Spotify and feel grateful I get to work at a company where I like what I do, my
colleagues, and the company culture.</li>
<li>By Friday, all that swimming has made me a tight wad of nerves and flesh. Trudge down to a
small Chinatown massage parlor where a masseur plies and kneads me until my muscles
open up again.</li>
<li>Realize on the weekends that I&rsquo;ve become the cheapest date on the planet. Refrain from
more than one or two drinks since I remember that time I finished swimming at night, had one beer,
and had a hangover the next morning.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost all of us have signed up for a free trial we then forgot to cancel
before getting charged for the next month or have felt uneasy entering credit card information
on a sketchy website. I discovered virtual credit card numbers several months ago and now use them
for both these cases.</p>

<p>Virtual credit card numbers (VCN) are credit card numbers that aren&rsquo;t associated with a physical
card. They are usually tied to your regular credit card account, and charges to the VCN will show
up on that credit card statement.</p>

<p>VCNs have two great features on top of regular credit card numbers. <strong>You can set the expiration and
maximum limit can be charged, and you can cancel them at any time.</strong> Let&rsquo;s say I want to try
<a href="https://www.spotify.com/premium/">Spotify Premium</a>. It&rsquo;s free for a month and $10 per month afterwards. I generate a VCN, set the limit
to $1 with an expiration of one month, enter that number into Spotify&rsquo;s website, and forget about
it. Use a VCN when you&rsquo;re wary that an online merchant might steal or is unable to protect your
card info as well.</p>

<p>So how does one get a VCN? The only free and bank-sponsored credit cards I know of that offer
them are <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/accounts-cards/shopsafe.go">Bank of America&rsquo;s ShopSafe feature</a> and <a href="https://www.cardbenefits.citi.com/products/virtual-account-numbers.aspx">Citibank&rsquo;s Virtual Account numbers</a>.
(<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-American-Express-discontinue-their-one-time-use-virtual-credit-card-numbers">Amex seems to have discontinued theirs.</a>)</p>

<p>There are cases when using a VCN might create more hassle than it&rsquo;s worth. The two I can think of
are booking a hotel room and needing to show your card when you arrive in person and returning a
purchase and trying to get a refund.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Please excuse the rambling nature of this post. It&rsquo;s more like a collection of thoughts mushed
together than a coherent essay.</em></p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> published an opinion piece a few weeks ago by a university cultural studies
instructor named Andrew Reiner about how conventional gender norms for
men in the US are restrictive and can harm not only women but also men themselves.
In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html">&ldquo;Teaching Men to be Emotionally Honest&rdquo;</a> Reiner said we teach boys from a young age what
emotions they are allowed to express. Boys are taught to convert their sadness or misery into anger;
vulnerability and compassion is best left to women and somehow makes a man less manly.</p>

<p>Reiner advocates for the creation of men&rsquo;s studies as an academic field
in its own right along with campus resource centers that would create &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; for guys.
He points out, however, that people can be skeptical of such efforts. A proposed <a href="http://thetyee.ca/News/2012/05/03/SFU-Mens-Centre/">Men&rsquo;s Centre at
Simon Fraser University</a> created debate over its intentions and usefulness.</p>

<blockquote><p>But wouldn&#8217;t encouraging men to embrace the full range of their humanity benefit women?
Why do we continue to limit the emotional lives of males when it serves no one?
This question is the rhetorical blueprint I pose to students before they begin what I call the
&#8220;Real Man&#8221; experiment.</p><footer><strong>Andrew Reiner</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html'>www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Reiner&rsquo;s piece makes me think about how masculinity has meant different things in different times
and places. Crying, for example, was more accepted in Greek heroes than it is in today&rsquo;s male
leaders. The <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19780_5-gender-stereotypes-that-used-to-be-exact-opposite.html">website Cracked.com says</a> (yes, I&rsquo;m quoting cracked.com),</p>

<blockquote><p>As recently as the 19th century, male tears were actually celebrated as a sign of honesty,
integrity and strength. And not in the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re brave enough to show your weakness&rdquo; way, but just
as a symbol that you actually gave a crap. And it probably also meant you were confident that no
one would mock you, since you had just won a battle or torn the limbs off of a monster with your
bare hands.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s say your parents own and rent out a couple of condominium units in the greater Boston area.
The lease is about to expire for one of the units that&rsquo;s rented out to a young Polish woman who is
a student.</p>

<p>Your mother Nancy emails the tenant, who we&rsquo;ll call Ashley to protect her real identity
and also because we all know a crazy girl who happens to have that name, several months ahead of
time to ask if she&rsquo;d
like to renew for another year given a monthly rent increase of $50. According to your mom, Ashley
implied she would sign the new lease, but it&rsquo;s been a couple of months and she hasn&rsquo;t sent a
signed copy back yet.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Ashley wrote an email complaining of multiple problems with
the apartment that she&rsquo;s never mentioned before. So what should your parents do?</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a guide on exactly how they should handle the situation. Tell their unhinged
broker Joe to deal with the crazy tenant and watch the situation spiral out of control.
All emails below are copy-pasted verbatim.</p>

<p><em>My parents have learned from this experience and no longer work with either tenant or broker.</em></p>

<p>The mice have taken over my house. I don&rsquo;t know how this happened. There are Many holes. I mean I
painted the whole house.i cleaned it for over 60 hours when I moved in . I tried to over up with

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine you had to leave your family and the only world you knew to travel to a far and unfamiliar
land. You need to do this to make enough money to give your loved ones the life you want for them.
You&rsquo;ll be gone for years if not decades.</p>

<p>Despite having a college or graduate degree, you have to do manual labor and menial tasks you find
beneath you. You&rsquo;ll face isolation and loneliness. You only interact with your spouse through
occasional phone calls since dialing home isn&rsquo;t cheap. You wonder if
he or she is still faithful. You watch your children grow up, get married, and have kids of
their own through photos and video chats.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, you return to a home that still remembers and has a place for you. If you&rsquo;re
not, you die in an alien land.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the job description of an extraterrestrial colonization mission. This is the life of
hundreds of thousands of migrant female workers from countries like the Philippines and Indonesia.
They work as maids and nannies all across the world including New York City.</p>

<p>This is how I feel after reading <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/the-sacrifices-of-an-immigrant-caregiver">&ldquo;The Cost of Caring&rdquo;</a> in last week&rsquo;s <em>New Yorker</em>
Read the article and try not to cry.</p>

<p>My mother worked briefly as a nanny when she first immigrated to the United States.
When she flew from China in 1989 to rejoin my father who had entered the University of Kentucky&rsquo;s
Ph.D. program in molecular biology, she didn&rsquo;t speak a word of English. She left me as a
one-year-old in the care of her parents. The plan was for me to rejoin them in a year
once my parents had set up their life in America.</p>

<p>My father picked my mother up from the airport, dropped her off at the rundown apartment building
where they shared a bathroom with another couple, and rushed back to work. She said she just
stayed at home and cried that day.</p>

<p>She tried to make money by babysitting other people&rsquo;s kids, but holding another toddler in her arms
reminded her of me. She quit and worked as a waitress instead.</p>

<p>It is a tragedy that countless women like Emma in the <em>New Yorker</em> article feel compelled to choose
between being with their children or providing for them. Emma said, &ldquo;I took my love for my own
children and I put it on these girls. I treated them as if they were my daughters.&rdquo; The author
Rachel Aviv describes how &ldquo;When the youngest boy [of another worker in the article named Ivy]
couldn&rsquo;t sleep, he sometimes crept upstairs and slipped into her bed. She said, &lsquo;The oldest
keeps asking me, &#8220;Ivy, do you really love me? When I&rsquo;m married, will you take care of my
children?&rdquo;&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>María Ibarra, a professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies at San Diego State University, calls
[foreign domestic workers] &#8220;emotional proletarians&#8221;: they &#8220;produce authentic emotion in exchange
for a wage.</p><footer><strong>Emma</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/the-sacrifices-of-an-immigrant-caregiver'>www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>If I had children and the choice, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to pay a stranger to give them care and
affection. For these reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to be complicit in yet another system that exploits gender and class differences.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m too proud and DIY to outsource such important work.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m selfish and would want my kids to love their biological parents more than anyone else.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday March 27 was my first day back in New York City after vacationing in the UK for ten days.
I stepped into a subway car and noticed
everyone was crowded around the entrance so I pushed my way into the less populated mid-section.
I soon realized why people were avoiding that area. A skinny, middle-aged man was trying to get the
attention of two young women sitting next to him. I don&rsquo;t remember what he was saying, but it was
obvious they felt uncomfortable and didn&rsquo;t want to talk. After they got off, he looked around and
asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is going on? Why are all the women standing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I crashed my jaguar. Now look at my knees. This one&rsquo;s bigger than that one. But I still get up to
give the women a seat. No woman should be on her feet. A man that hits his woman ain&rsquo;t worth shit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most people were trying their best to ignore him. I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh a bit. He then tried
to strike up a conversation with some other men around him. I missed the beginning but was able
to overhear this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill them. I&rsquo;ll do it for nothing. I don&rsquo;t want you to pay $100,000 for your daughter to go
to Harvard and then get raped by a rich motherfucker. I hate rapists and pedophiles so I&rsquo;ll do it
for free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got off at my stop and started reading the <em>New York Times</em> on my phone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults on Easter Sunday morning over recent
smears against their wives, while Mr. Trump ruled out creating internment camps for American
Muslims and said he would study a proposal to allow delegates to bring guns to the Republican
National Convention.</p><footer><strong>New York Times</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/27/donald-trump-and-ted-cruz-continue-clash-over-spouses/'>www.nytimes.com/politics/2016/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Ah, it&rsquo;s good to be back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished planning a vacation I&rsquo;ll take with my parents through the southern parts of the UK.
Here&rsquo;s our itinerary in case anyone else finds it useful. I spent a day researching the worthwhile
destinations close to London.</p>

<p>This itinerary is an opinionated one. I left out Stonehenge (forums
said that unless I&rsquo;m really into anthropology, it&rsquo;ll just be a pile of big rocks to me), chose
Cambridge instead of Oxford (they&rsquo;re similar and Cambridge has the magnificent King&rsquo;s College
Chapel), and opted for the Seven Sisters over the White Cliffs of Dover (I found out the White
Cliffs aren&rsquo;t that white anymore).</p>

<p>The only undecided part of this itinerary is whether and where to get the rental car for the
Jurassic Coast. Let me know if you have good ideas.</p>

<h2>March 18 - London</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This guide will show you how to use Gmail to send and receive emails from a custom domain for free.
Google Apps for custom domains used to be free back in the day for domains with less than 10 users.
But sadly, now you have to pay $5 a month for that unless you were grandfathered in.</p>

<p>Some other web pages out there also say you can send email for free using Mailgun. But it&rsquo;s
a lot harder and slower to setup and caps the number of emails you can send per month.</p>

<p>Just follow the steps below to enjoy receiving and sending email from a custom domain for free!</p>

<ol>
<li>You must already have a Gmail account, e.g. <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#105;&#100;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#46;">&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#105;&#100;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#x2e;</a></li>
<li>Register a custom domain like example.com with any number of domain registrars like
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=91960">namecheap.com</a> that offers free email forwarding.</li>
<li>Setup email forwarding in your domain registrar&rsquo;s admin console to forward email from a custom
email address like <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#105;&#100;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#105;&#x64;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#x6d;&#112;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> to <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;&#46;">&#x64;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#x64;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;</a></li>
<li>Go to Gmail&rsquo;s settings page and click on the &ldquo;Accounts&rdquo; section.</li>
<li>In the section labeled &ldquo;Send email as:&rdquo; click &ldquo;Add another email address you own.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A pop-up window will appear. Type in your name and custom email address <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x64;&#97;&#x76;&#105;&#100;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#x2e;">&#x64;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#100;&#x40;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6c;&#101;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;</a></li>
<li>The next page will ask you which email or SMTP servers to use to send email. For this part,
you need to have two-factor verification setup with your Gmail account. You need to generate
a new app-specific password with two-factor.</li>
<li>Fill out the form like so: SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com, Username: david@gmail.com,
Password: [app-specific password].</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;add acccount&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The next page will say to enter the verification code in the email sent to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#100;&#x61;&#x76;&#105;&#100;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#x6d;&#112;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;">&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#x69;&#x64;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#x2e;</a>
Since we setup email forwarding to forward to your Gmail david@gmail.com, just wait a few
minutes and you should get the email soon. Type in the code.</li>
<li>Tada. You should now be able to send email from <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x64;&#97;&#x76;&#105;&#x64;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#105;&#x64;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> as <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#x69;&#x64;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#x2e;">&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#46;</a> Just
compose a new email and click on the from field. You should see <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> as an option.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a month ago, I saw a video that Amandla Stenberg, an actress known for playing Rue in the
<em>Hunger Games</em> among other roles, made for her high school history class. In a video titled
<a href="http://amandla.tumblr.com/post/107484511963/dont-cash-crop-my-cornrows-a-crash-discourse-on" title="Don't Cash Crop My Cornrows">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Cash Crop My Cornrows,&rdquo;</a> Stenberg gives a summary of black hairstyles and hip-hop over the
last two decades and how they&rsquo;ve become popular in mainstream culture. Artists from Riff Raff to
Katy Perry to Iggy Azalea have recently sported grills and picked up ebonics and hip hop musical
styles in their music videos.</p>

<p>She seems very articulate and well-spoken in this video. So much so that it made me
wonder, what the hell what I doing in high school. I was certainly not making viral videos like this that
so insightfully dissects recent trends in pop culture.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also too bad that history teachers often don&rsquo;t make history more relevant and relatable. Dry
facts about slavery and Jim Crow come alive when kids are taught that decisions our ancestors made
reverberate all around us.</p>
