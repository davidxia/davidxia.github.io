  <div class="entry-content"><p>We pay a lot of attention to elections where we voice our opinions by voting. But there&rsquo;s a more
important form of voting that happens everyday. When I spend money, whether I know it or not, I&rsquo;m
often supporting not only a good or service but also a set of principles and values.</p>

<p>One example is grocery shopping. Michael Pollan writes in his book <em>Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma</em>, &ldquo;Shopping
in the organic supermarket underwrites important values on the farm; shopping locally underwrites
a whole set of other values as well.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
Buying a dollar of organic produce means one less dollar for the non-organic food industry. It&rsquo;s a
vote for one over the other, and vice versa if you buy non-organic over organic.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>How I spend each and every dollar is a vote, a political act. I&rsquo;m making my wallet speak for me.
So let&rsquo;s not forget that voting for politicians may happen only once every two years, but voting
with your wallet happens everyday.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Principles Then Live by Them</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how some people call themselves anti-capitalist (I&rsquo;m talking about people who
are socially and politically liberal) yet are voracious consumers of industrial goods. That&rsquo;s
hypocritical. By being a consumer, they&rsquo;re essentially voting dollar-for-dollar for the capitalist
system (unless they&rsquo;re strictly buying from fair trade organizations or from groups who don&rsquo;t put
profit as their bottom line). It&rsquo;s as absurd as a moral vegetarian buying leather shoes or someone
who works at a non-profit to provide safe drinking water to developing countries regularly buying
bottled water. (By the way, bottled water is a not a necessity, it&rsquo;s a luxury and a life-style
choice.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that if you have reservations against capitalism, the only way to retain the moral
high ground is to live in the woods and grow your own food. There are practical limits. I&rsquo;m
concerned about climate change, but I&rsquo;m not willing to paddle a boat across the Pacific instead of
getting on a plane for China. I&rsquo;m advocating a more thoughtful approach to consumption within
bounds of reason and practicality. Eating less meat is better for the environment in that it&rsquo;s a
carbon offset, but vegetarians who force their dogs to be vegetarians don&rsquo;t understand that dogs
have evolved to be <a href="http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/canine-nutrition/dogs-carnivores-omnivores/"><em>carnivores</em></a>.</p>

<p>We should strive for consistency between values and action. Hypocrites suck. If you love cigarette
companies and love smoking that&rsquo;s fine. If you think big banks can never be too big to fail and
the bigger they are the better, more power to you. But if you believe in animal rights, don&rsquo;t buy
furs and leather.</p>
