  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve always liked to write and decided a good way to share my writing was on a personal blog.
Three years ago I registered a free WordPress blog with the url &ldquo;davidxia.worpdress.com.&rdquo; I
decided the &ldquo;wordpress&rdquo; in my URL was lame so I Googled how to buy a domain name. I registered
&ldquo;davidxia.com&rdquo; through GoDaddy and rented some hosting space. (Unfortunately I rented hosting
space with GoDaddy because I didn&rsquo;t know any better. I&rsquo;ve since switched to <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>.)</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I didn&rsquo;t like my WordPress blog&rsquo;s default theme so I browsed other ones. I didn&rsquo;t like any that I
saw out of the box. I looked at the raw source of the web page and saw lots of funky greater and
less than signs. I didn&rsquo;t understand any of it. I knew it was called HTML so I read up on it. I
could now make a bare bones webpage. I wanted to customize my blog&rsquo;s design so I learned about web
design and CSS.</p>

<p>I wanted to track the number of visitors to my website and to filter spam comments. I discovered
WordPress provided plugins that fixed these problems. I learned how to install them. I wanted to
make my website rank higher in Google search results so I read about search engine optimization.</p>

<p>My blog was a creative outlet for my thoughts and a way to exercise my prose. I started writing
more as my traffic numbers grew. My blog introduced me to PHP since WordPress is written in that
language.</p>

<p>After I graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in mathematics in May 2010, I worked at an
online marketing company in Manhattan. Although I was offered consulting and finance positions, I
decided to work for the only technology company to which I applied.</p>

<p>I had only taken a single class in computer science before I started working: Introduction to
Computer Science and Java. The most complicated program I wrote was an algorithm that played a
dice game called <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piggame.html">Pig</a>. At the end of the semester, students pitted their &ldquo;players&rdquo; against
each other to see who had the smartest algorithm. My player ranked near the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>At this marketing company, I was in their quality assurance department on a team responsible for
testing their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence">business intelligence</a> infrastructure. I helped make sure terabytes of data
about clicks and financial transactions that were loaded into one place was correctly transferred
to another place. After working there for half a year I wanted to create something on my own and
to tackle something more challenging.</p>

<p>I had a lot of free time during my job and couldn&rsquo;t stand the boredom. I started reading online
Perl language tutorials after making friends with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator">system administrators</a> who worked near
me.</p>

<p>I bought a black and white Amazon Kindle. I wanted to read the New York Times during my long
subway ride to work each morning. But I didn&rsquo;t want to pay for a digital subscription. I also
didn&rsquo;t want to tediously copy/paste the articles from my computer browser and save into my Kindle.
So I wrote a Perl script that did it in a couple of seconds. I started talking to researchers at
my company who were familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>. I
came up with ideas about analyzing keywords from New York Times&#8217; daily front page articles and
playing with the data. These researchers encouraged me to check out Python&rsquo;s comprehensive
<a href="http://www.nltk.org">natural language toolkit</a>. I wanted these powerful software tools so I started learning Python
by Googling &ldquo;Python beginner tutorial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://www.sthurlow.com/python/">this</a>, then read <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">this</a>, and then finished <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html">this</a>. I realized that when
I only read through tutorials and copied/pasted code samples into my computer, I learned much less
than when I typed out the code. It made sense. In order to learn a new language I&rsquo;d have to not
only listen and read but also speak and write. To learn an instrument, I&rsquo;d have to play the actual
notes and not just read sheet music.</p>

<p>I converted my Perl scripts into Python and wrote <a href="/projects/programming-and-software">more Python programs</a>. But it wasn&rsquo;t until
I founded a company with my <a href="/2011/09/my-awesome-cofounder-and-advisors/">cofounder James</a> that I seriously started learning how to
program. Writing simple scripts is nothing compared to launching a web application. I quit my job
around January 20, 2011 and from then until August 1, 2011, I spent at least 80 hours a week
programming.</p>

<p>I am lucky. I have almost no financial obligations. No family, no student debt, no mortgage.
Coming from a privileged background, I had nearly total freedom because I had no external
responsibilities.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have done this without James and our two technical advisors Ben and Nan. James is one
of the most affable, able, and ambitious people I know. Ben and Nan gladly taught me nearly every
technical thing I know today.</p>

<p>In the beginning I had no idea what I was doing. I would identify a problem, Google for the
answer, copy/paste code from a random website, and run the program. If it didn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;d repeat.
Things slowly started making sense. I learned to configure servers, design data models, and write
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">elegant objects</a>. Writing RESTful CRUD apps every waking moment became boring, so I delved
into the theoretical aspects of computer science. So I learned how computer manages memory,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">big O notation</a>, search algorithms, linked lists, binary trees, and how to implement hash
maps. I learned a bit of C along the way.</p>

<p>I attribute 80% of my progress during those six months to my own elbow grease; 19% to the support
from my colleagues, family, and friends; and 1% to my naïveté and optimism that allowed me to quit
my job in the first place and take the plunge into six months of engineering and entrepreneurial
bootcamp.</p>

<p>In the end, I was comforted to learn that hard work counts for something in the real world. I now
know that the biggest difference between someone who has wanted to learn to program for a long
time but hasn&rsquo;t started and a software engineer is mindset. Once I had the mindset, anything was
possible.</p>
